<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Next Chapter</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The car eased down the off-ramp.  A line of vehicles were backed up behind a slower moving truck, and Avery fidgeted.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that the highway was safer than anywhere else, here, but Avery adjusted, more on the alert now, her Sight scanning the surroundings.  On the highway, if anything happened, it was mostly up to her mom and her mom&#8217;s driving to avoid it.  Now it was up to her.  And it wasn&#8217;t exactly easy to do anything with Sheridan in the car.</p>
<p>Other cars were keeping pace with them, one leading, one trailing behind.  In the convertible, Sootsleeves was behind the wheel, cigarette firmly in her mouth, hair flapping in what had to be a <em>bracing</em> cold wind, given the temperature.  The one that was behind or sometimes beside them was a battered old car with tinted windows, a group of people inside <em>belting </em>out a song that included top-of-the-lung yodeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You going to leave me hanging?&#8221; Sheridan asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were saying something and then you got distracted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Apparently</em> Verona thinks that Auntie Tracy and Uncle Sean got pregnant with Kyle at the wedding, and that&#8217;s part of why Auntie C is <em>still</em> pissed because she had dibs or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom sighed.  &#8220;And how did she get the information she needed to draw that conclusion?  Do I even want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just good at connecting dots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re hard dots to connect,&#8221; Sheridan said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty obvious if you spend, like, five seconds in our family, which your friend did.  Did you seriously not know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a two and a half year head start on getting this stuff,&#8221; Avery protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew when I was Kerry&#8217;s age.  Kyle might as well have it branded on his forehead.  &#8216;Was conceived in a sloppy coatroom quickie&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheridan!&#8221; their mom cut in, shocked.  She fumbled her words for a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our mom&#8217;s actually lost for words.  Do I get points?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we were keeping score,&#8221; Avery said, eyes searching the area in a way that felt very &#8216;game mode&#8217;.  Player on the ice, who&#8217;s open, who&#8217;s not?  &#8220;But you get points in my book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No adjectives when talking about your aunt and uncle&#8217;s love life, please, Sheridan.  This is already a weird topic for the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know how you know these details,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the &#8216;sloppy&#8217;, or-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheridan!  Come on.  Please,&#8221; their mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay fine.  I know because I pay attention?  Did you seriously only figure it out when Verona told you, Avery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kyle only found out when Verona brought it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; their mom said.</p>
<p>Sheridan laughed.  &#8220;How did I have to miss out on that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe because we went for a walk together and you&#8217;re lazy and stayed behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That tracks.  Aw.  If you got it on video and you let me see, I&#8217;ll be your maid for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No luck,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tragic.  But seriously, I think we should all have lurid details branded on our foreheads.  Kyle gets the adjective-free coatroom conception.  Breanne&#8217;s first crush was a cartoon character.  Uncle Declan cheated on his wife and got dumped by both women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not be mean, come on,&#8221; their mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you even know me?&#8221; Sheridan asked.  &#8220;Come on.  I&#8217;m actually a one hundred and twenty pound girl with sixty pounds of mean, sass, and sarcasm in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lovely, honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha ha.  As if.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you put on your own forehead?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not as mean if you can poke fun at yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re assuming I want to be less mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re done with this topic of conversation,&#8221; their mom said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it going anywhere good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traffic was moving off the off-ramp now.  She felt so tired- and it wasn&#8217;t because she&#8217;d woken up early and then rushed to go see Liberty or anything.  Watching out, not knowing what could come or from what angle, while constantly considering her mom&#8230;</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery likes big girls and cannot lie,&#8221; Sheridan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Avery asked, startled.  She looked at her mom, then back at Sheridan.  &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For your forehead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re done with that topic of conversation, Sheridan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Avery asked, again.  &#8220;Why the &#8216;cannot lie&#8217; bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a saying, numbnuts.  You&#8217;re out to mom, I can say this now, right?  I can&#8217;t help but notice you&#8217;re not denying the &#8216;big girls&#8217; part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheridan, if you carry on with this topic, I&#8217;m grounding you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I move to appeal to the court of Dad.  I&#8217;m just making conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of all that is holy, <em>please</em>.  I&#8217;m stressed enough as is.  Stop, or I won&#8217;t buy you snacks here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inhumane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would get me attacked, I bet,&#8221; Avery muttered.  &#8220;Having that on my forehead all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the thing on your backpack strap.  How is that different?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can leave the backpack behind, and a lot of the jerks out there don&#8217;t even know what the flag means.  I don&#8217;t think Grumble knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truuuue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s mom reached over to put a hand on her shoulder, rubbing for a second.  &#8220;I worry about you.  So much.  For so many reasons.  You too, Sheridan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good token follow-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They pulled into the gas station, and Avery&#8217;s mom pulled up to the gas pump.  There weren&#8217;t all that many people around, but it was the middle of the morning on a weekday, and this was just one town off the side of the road.</p>
<p>Sootsleeves pulled into one corner of the gas station parking lot, while the Car Song circled the block.</p>
<p>Sheridan was the first one out of the car.  &#8220;Gotta pee.  Don&#8217;t leave without me.  Or do.  I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery sat in the passenger seat, a little shell shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know, right?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared me.  &#8216;Cannot lie&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second or two passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we okay?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.  I wish we hadn&#8217;t pulled off the highway though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need gas, and Sheridan needed to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I guess we&#8217;ll find out how this goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go get some snacks.  Here, buy snacks and pay for the gas.  Keep an eye out for Sheridan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery took the cash, unzipped her bag, and pulled a sleepy Snowdrop out.  &#8220;Watch my mom.  Hide when I signal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop sneezed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora wasn&#8217;t that big, was she?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom asked.  &#8220;She&#8217;s even on the petite size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my god.  No, don&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just remarking.  Was Sheridan wrong, or-?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out.  Bye, nope.  Nope.  Not having this conversation right now,&#8221; Avery said, getting out of the car, giving Snowdrop a momentary scratch.</p>
<p>This was a town Avery recognized, now that she thought about it.  One of the first lordship claims had been here.  It made it feel all the more ominous.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t even halfway from the gas pump to the little gas station convenience store when a pay phone off to the side started to ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when do pay phones still exist?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>She wondered for a second if she should just ignore it or if she should approach.  But she remembered Verona&#8217;s advice from all the way back at the end of summer, about Lords and lordships, and even though this wasn&#8217;t necessarily a <em>friendly</em> Lord, if they were trying to reach out&#8230;</p>
<p>She approached it, pausing, looking at Sootsleeves, who had a few pigeons perched on the side of her car.  She smoked, watching Avery through sunglasses.  No warnings or anything there.</p>
<p>Avery picked up.</p>
<p>The world went dark, and a low buzz filled the air.</p>
<p>And her eyes had to adjust to the gloom.  Lightning flashed in the background, and it was like trying to see light on the far end of a forest- bits making their way between trees and branches.</p>
<p>Except it was wires.</p>
<p>She took an uneasy step, then stumbled, dropping to a crouch and managing to catch her balance there instead of falling over.</p>
<p>The ground was bodies.  Humans, in varying states of dress, piled up, stacked, draping over one another.  She could barely make it out in the gloom, and had to wait several seconds for various flashes of lightning or light to reach far enough for her to see.</p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t dead.  They lay there, barely breathing, eyes and mouths open, every last one of them letting out constant, low groans.  The buzz was the sound of all those groans combining, mingling with the sounds of fans, of technology, generators, maybe.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d been altered.  Their eyes were lit by some faint light from within- not enough to illuminate or read by, but enough that she could see each open set of eyes as her eyes adjusted.</p>
<p>And their ears had been cut off.  Some still bled, others looked red and raw, with only trickles, or beads of bright red standing out red in the light-flickers, against backdrops of clotted scab and skin painted with beads and smears of it.  Some had other injuries- limbs bent the wrong way, or they&#8217;d hurt their faces, or there were cuts.  But all were earless, and that was the worst damage for most of them.</p>
<p>Avery straightened, then picked her way forward, testing each footstep, wanting to apologize for each person she stepped on.  But they weren&#8217;t aware enough to care.</p>
<p>A knocking sound straight ahead helped indicate the direction.</p>
<p>The occasional flash that was close was enough that her eyes needed to adjust all over again from the start.  Or that was what it felt like.  She covered her eyes at one flash, and then let her eyes adjust, where she saw a table.</p>
<p>Not a table.  It was a row of air conditioner units, like ones from a big building.  fans on the top of each, some with wire guards, some without, were all spinning away, humming and squeaking, joining their noises to the dull buzz.  The knocking came from a shoe on one fan with a partial guard, that lifted up every time the blade passed, then banged against metal on the way down.</p>
<p>There were three different pay phones here, planted in the sea of bodies, two of the three standing at a slant.  The third had been slammed down someone&#8217;s throat, splitting it at the sides before disappearing into the general neck area and torso.  There was no light in that person&#8217;s eyes.  No buzz.  No fresh bleeding at the dismembered ears.</p>
<p>A man stood at the very edges of her vision, arms and legs limp and dangling.  Feet not touching the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heya,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Are you the local Lord?&#8221;</p>
<p>The response sounded like it played from an old tape player, pre-recorded and degraded.  <em>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The voice didn&#8217;t come from the man, but from something behind him.  Something black and covered in wires.  Big.  The line between it and the surrounding walls and wires was hard to make out.  Nothing glowed or shone, or caught any particular light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Announcing myself as Avery Kelly.  Second witch of Kennet, resident of Thunder Bay.  Finder and Path Runner.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited, hoping the voice would reply.  It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask if I can pass through,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to practice, except to communicate with my familiar.  I&#8217;m not with Musser.  If that helps.&#8221;</p>
<p>A piece of dark gray sheet metal moved to the side of the floating man&#8217;s head.  No, he wasn&#8217;t floating.  He was being held.</p>
<p>The metal had been torn away from other metal, and the uneven edge was dragged against the ear, sawing, until the ear came free.  The man&#8217;s struggles were feeble- he barely lifted his hands.  Blood flowed freely out.</p>
<p>The other ear was sawed off too.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;What if I say no?&#8221;</em> the voice asked.  And it came from the same place, even as the man with the freshly removed ears was moved to the side, placed against the wall, and lashed there with wires wrapped in black insulation and black tape.  The fact the man hung from neck and armpit barely provoked a reaction.</p>
<p>That man had moved a good twenty or thirty feet, no problem.  Lifted like he weighed nothing.  Moved not like he&#8217;d been walked over, but like he was a doll in a typical dollhouse, being played with by someone or something life-size.</p>
<p>Something about this felt a lot like being in the Ornithologist&#8217;s realm.</p>
<p>Or being at the Forest Ribbon Trail with the Wolf.</p>
<p>Which made the words hard to find.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t honestly know,&#8221; Avery replied.  &#8220;Are you saying no?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Avery hesitated.  She hadn&#8217;t expected that, and the unexpected in this kind of place sent a shock running through her.  &#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Now what?&#8221;</em> the voice asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thin-&#8221;</p>
<p>A body dropped out of the sky, caught a wire on the way down, and flopped over onto the row of air conditioning units.  Ragdoll limp.  The arm hit a spinning fan and was struck with enough force that it was thrown off, flesh sliced off into a peel, curling away from the inner elbow, hanging off the wrist.</p>
<p>A woman.  She convulsed where she lay, eventually going still.</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s heart threw a shit-fit, like it was trying to break her ribs or suffocate her.</p>
<p>And the figure in the shadows just past Avery&#8217;s ability to see reached out, dragging her closer.  Picking her up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; Avery managed to respond.  &#8220;What comes next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wires were wrapped around the injured arm, holding things mostly in place.  Then the ears were removed from the sides of the head, using a tool that was neither knife nor saw, inefficient in every way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they alive?&#8221; Avery asked, still doing her best to calm down.  &#8220;Locals?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;They&#8217;re decoration.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  That&#8217;s, hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Not super clear</em>, Avery thought.</p>
<p>The woman was placed against a wall, sitting up.  Her hands were placed in her lap, her head adjusted so it wasn&#8217;t hanging forward.  Her jaw was pushed shut, mouth closed, but then fell open again.</p>
<p>The signs of technomancy were all over this place.  It might have even been one of the technomancy realms.  Wires, disparate tech, the focus on the phones, the buzz&#8230;</p>
<p>Technomancy wasn&#8217;t usually a realm that really stuck and held.  Technologies, especially communication technologies, had a way of coming and going.  That meant it usually had to latch onto another realm for any staying power, and both the Abyss and the Ruins were good candidates.  The memories and impressions of technology and the troves of old tech that were left for the earth to swallow up could all support those things.</p>
<p>This felt like it was in that direction.  The Lord here could&#8217;ve been an Other that bridged that gap.</p>
<p>Four more falling bodies made Avery jump- and when she jumped she stumbled.  She only just barely managed to avoid falling.  The leg of one banged loudly against the air conditioning unit, while the rest fell in the dark.</p>
<p>She watched as they were dragged into the dark.  Avery frowned, wanting to shift her footing and fidget, but not trusting the uneven ground.</p>
<p>She felt nervous.  More nervous because she knew she had a few maybe-escape-routes, but she didn&#8217;t know this kind of realm enough to be sure.  And this was a Lord&#8217;s space, both in that it was their region, and also that it felt like a pocket dimension.  So there was a chance the Lord could withdraw her ability to practice here.</p>
<p>&#8220;You having fun there?&#8221; she asked, to fill the silence.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t sure what answer she&#8217;d expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your move,&#8221; she told the Lord.  &#8220;You tell me if there&#8217;s a way for me to pass through, or whatever, I respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bad-recording voice replied from the dark, <em>&#8220;There is another Lord close to here.  She has an Other in her domain.  A Child-Taker.  An old one.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The Beorgmann?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You know.  Good.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Okay?  And?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Give me something.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want information?  A deal?  Help dealing with it?&#8221; Avery asked.  When there wasn&#8217;t a response, she added, &#8220;I was there when it was released.  I didn&#8217;t hear what was said, but the person who released it was Milly Legendre.  Sealer, among other things.  She&#8217;s our prisoner right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;That will do.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;What will do?  Milly?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re in a place where I could let her out, make a deal.  If her family was responsible for binding that Other, they could bind it again.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;No.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;No?  No what?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let her out.  Ensure she can never bind again.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean kill her?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;That would be one way.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Avery shook her head.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Or remove her ears, her eyes, her tongue, her hands.  That is another way.  Or run electricity through her until her senses leave her and never return.  That would be how I would do it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If you are hesitant, give her to me.  I will do it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Avery frowned.</p>
<p>She jumped again as another man fell, hitting wires on the way down and pulling a cascade of wall-mounted breaker boxes down with him.  He was buried as he landed, one of the boxes sparking as it lay across him.  He wasn&#8217;t wearing pants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Child-Taker would accept it as a favor.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was dragged out from beneath the pile of debris, by hands or limbs Avery couldn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could kill her or anything.  But if you want her kept away&#8230; we can keep her prisoner, I think.  I&#8217;d have to talk to people.  It&#8217;s not totally up to me.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Swear.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Avery shook her head.  &#8220;No.  I don&#8217;t know enough.  I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s escaped already.  I could swear and be forsworn right away.  No.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Tell me you will do something that matters to keep her secure.  Tell me so I can tell the Child Taker that in good faith.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a prisoner, I don&#8217;t think we have any reason to let her go just yet.  So&#8230; maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Keep her from communicating with others.  Keep her where she is.  If she or her words escape your side&#8217;s custody, you will not have permission to safety enter or pass through our territories.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Our?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Mine and my allies.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s, uh&#8230; I&#8217;d like a time limit.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;No.  If she goes free, our tolerance for you ends and must be re-earned.  You may come to any of us before then to negotiate that earning.  Come with ideas and offerings fresh.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  I think I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;She is in the custody of Thunder Bay?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Tell them the same applies to them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;They might not like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221;</em> the voice replied.  It finally finished the fifth person, the pantsless guy, removing his ears, and pushed him into the ground, to fill a gap.  Bodies around him moved and shifted as they were pushed up against, until they were all thoroughly wedged in together.</p>
<p>Twelve severed ears were laid on the very edge of the air conditioning unit, closest to the voice in the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I ask your name?  It would help.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have no interest in helping you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;It would help me get this done, communicate to them, get everyone in line, serving your goals and ours.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have no interest in helping you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Metal banged, sharp, and Avery thought a body might have fallen, but it hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The bang came from within one of the center air conditioning units.  It banged again, then again, as the fan collided with metal.</p>
<p>Smashing itself to pieces as metal and plexiglass with an &#8216;A.G.&#8217; company logo and graffiti on it slowly rose.  The fan blade bent, repeatedly smacking the wire cage that had kept any reaching hands from accidentally getting stuck in the way, and then, as one piece rose up, it hit it and broke off, flying into the darkness.</p>
<p>Until the little motor without blades attached was left whining and squealing, a pay phone standing tall and proud from the air conditioner, looming above.</p>
<p>Avery paused, checking the coast was clear and that nothing else was being presented.  To reach the phone, she had to put her foot up on the side of the air conditioning unit- about three or four inches of metal between her foot and the nearest blade.  The metal had blood, old and new, covering it.</p>
<p>She stepped up, grabbed the phone, and put it to her ear.</p>
<p>The light was blinding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery blinked, and turned around.  It took her a second to get her bearings.</p>
<p>Sootsleeves was on her guard, surrounded by more mice and birds than before, sitting on the upper edge of her car door cigarette lowered.  The Car Song had parked.  Her mom stood by the car, frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have the money for the snacks?&#8221; Sheridan asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to buy something,&#8221; Avery said.  She checked her footing.  The images of the mutilated, droning bodies stuck in her vision in the same way staring at a bright object and then going into the dark could leave an imprint behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get snacks already, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; Avery said, fishing in her pocket for the bills her mom had given her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;ve got something on your cheek, looks like jam, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery rubbed, missing whatever it was twice before Sheridan took hold of her wrist and moved her hand into it.</p>
<p>Tiny flecks of blood.  From the falling bodies.</p>
<p>Avery went into the gas station store, picked out a peach iced tea and some nuts, and then left them with Sheridan while she went to the counter to get the key to the bathroom.  She got the remaining flecks and smears, washing hard.</p>
<p>Sheridan was just leaving as she exited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sir?&#8221; the guy behind the counter asked.</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.  &#8220;Sure?  Hmm.  Have there been a lot of disappearances around here, recently?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wondering.  Wondering if someone&#8217;s messing with me or if this town and area are suddenly missing a few hundred people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s messing with you,&#8221; the guy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him the key back, then went to the car.  She sensed Snowdrop getting tossed around, and jogged the last bit.  Sheridan had taken the passenger seat, pitching the bag into the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything okay?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm hmm.  I guess,&#8221; Avery said, taking her snacks out of the bag that rested on the center console.  &#8220;No more stops?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really eager to get to school, huh?&#8221; her mom asked, tone artificially bright.</p>
<p><em>I hope the way is clear.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Yeah, I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery checked Snowdrop was okay, discreetly sharing some nuts and raisins from the trail mix, and sat quietly, watching out the window, as they pulled back onto the highway.</p>
<p>Both Sootsleeves and the Car Song moved closer, and Avery wondered if they were more protective after Avery had been scooped up by the pay phone Other.</p>
<p>Then she saw.  They&#8217;d left one region and passed into another.</p>
<p>The area was slowly changing tint, in the same way everything around could look blue if the sun was shining directly onto a giant blue object.</p>
<p>But the object wasn&#8217;t giant.  The tinting drew her eye over, and she saw a distant figure on top of a water tower, dressed in blue, wearing a gold crown.</p>
<p>A gargantuan shape, easily capable of standing taller than the water tower, even grazing the clouds above, was visible only as blue tint, see-through where there was none.  It looked like a woman without arms, or a woman with a cloak or dress that draped down in a way that hid her arms from view.  She walked so she stepped on rooftops, skipping when she needed to cross a street.</p>
<p>The huge, translucent woman bent down by the water tower, as if bringing her ear close enough to hear something being said.  She nodded.</p>
<p>Both the huge woman and the little crowned figure on the water tower watched their car as it moved down the highway, cutting past a town smaller than Kennet.</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s mom laughed, high and nervous.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Sheridan asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing- don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; their mom said.  &#8220;Right?  That&#8217;s what they say?  No worries?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Mom&#8217;s losing it,&#8221; Sheridan said, in a stage whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might just be,&#8221; their mom replied.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s get you girls to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>She hated being late.  She jogged down the hall as fast as she could without making noise.  She opened the door to Mr. Carlson&#8217;s class, not hiding her embarrassment as she interrupted.</p>
<p>Jeanine was sitting in the middle of class, surrounded by some members of the team, including Hui and Putnam.  Nora sat at the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms. Kelly, welcome back.  Class started ten minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry.  My family woke up before six this morning and left early, we tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I appreciate the effort.  I know Mr. Artrip raves about your contributions to the school track team, so I think we can cut you some slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was aware of the eyes of the entire class on her.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t want special treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, then I&#8217;ll give you detention.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;oh.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t want that either.&#8221;</p>
<p>The class laughed, Jeanine more than most.  Hui was making a show of slapping her hand against her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;After practice?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me between classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.  Then she hurried over to her seat, sitting by Jeanine, letting him continue his lesson on business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screwed yourself over,&#8221; Jeanine murmured, the moment he turned around to write on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, maybe.  But wouldn&#8217;t people have hated me if I just took the offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?  Because you&#8217;re a star.  You contribute to school crap, you get school benefits.  It&#8217;s not rocket science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanine sounded so innocent as she said that, but Avery could remember how the Dancers had gotten to leave early every day for a week last year, back in Kennet, and how weird that had seemed.  Especially when the Dancers weren&#8217;t even a school thing, specifically.</p>
<p>It felt a lot like every other conversation she had with Jeanine went this way.  An inability to connect.  Weird arguments.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to have you back,&#8221; Jeanine said.</p>
<p>Hui, a seat in front of Avery, glanced back and put a fist out and back.  Avery gave her a quick fist-bump.</p>
<p>Putnam, sitting the aisle over, same row as Hui, shot a quick smile Avery&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Team stuff she&#8217;d wished she&#8217;d had back in Kennet.  It was nice.  The Jeanine stuff was awkward but overall&#8230; nice.</p>
<p>She glanced back at Nora, who lifted up her fingers from her workbook to give a tiny finger-waggle wave.  Avery smiled.</p>
<p>Team stuff aside, she really, <em>really</em> wished she was sitting by Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang out later?&#8221; Jeanine murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I really want to, but there&#8217;s a lot going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanine looked away, and there was a look in her eyes that was <em>almost</em> an eye roll.</p>
<p>Avery suppressed a sigh.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Avery jogged around to the front of the school, looking around.  She wished Snowdrop attended school, so she could have her helping.  Instead, Snow was guarding the above-garage patio back at the house, fast asleep.</p>
<p>Nora was sitting on the front steps of the school.  Big black duffel jacket, black sweater, a gray plaid skirt, and something on the skirt that made Avery think of the bag that some guys wore with kilts.  Avery liked that.  The black and gray was broken up here and there with decorations on backpack, the bag on the chain, and the candy jewelry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You waited.  All this time?&#8221;  Avery had done a quick thirty minute track practice and then gone back into school to have a conversation with Mr. Carlson about &#8216;detention&#8217;, which he&#8217;d waived after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listening to music.  It&#8217;s cool.  Glad you weren&#8217;t much longer.  It&#8217;s too cold to sit for too long but too annoying to stand around.  Is that okay?  Me staying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Super okay,&#8221; Avery said, beaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk much before,&#8221; Nora said, standing, drawing her shoulders together in a kind of sustained shrug.</p>
<p>They stood about five feet apart, Avery smiling, Nora about as visibly happy as she got.  Avery wanted to hug Nora, but the moment to do that would&#8217;ve been when they reunited, and Nora had been sitting down, <em>and</em> Nora wasn&#8217;t out so an ill-timed hug would&#8217;ve been awkward.  Just in case Nora&#8217;s mom was in the parking lot or something.  So Avery just stood there, hands in the pockets of her nice sweatshirt, bouncing faintly on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with you?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mom is on a yoga kick.  She keeps asking us to do it first thing in the morning.  My dad says no but my brothers are gung-ho for it.  I don&#8217;t know why I led with that bit of news.  I told you most other stuff by text.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, how do you get gung-ho for yoga?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting yoga shorts and yoga tops and choosing yoga mats with patterns.  Learning new stances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brothers are weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they?  I know you&#8217;re supposed to think your family is normal but they&#8217;re <em>realllly</em> weird,&#8221; Nora said, narrowing her eyes.  &#8220;Really happy and obedient and normal.  They&#8217;re almost <em>smug</em> about it.  About being good, and about the yoga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can both imagine that and have a hard time with it at the same time.  Does that make sense?  Like I can picture it, but it&#8217;s weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try living it.  I was eating steel cut oats in the kitchen this morning and there they are in the other room, they aren&#8217;t even twins, but they&#8217;re mirroring each other, doing downward dog while looking so pleased with themselves it&#8217;s oozing out of them, and my mom&#8217;s just taking this supposedly relaxing activity and <em>stressing out </em>all the way through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Not his thing.  He&#8217;s all, have fun, I&#8217;m going to go putter around in the back yard.  Except without that many words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s my life right now.  Really hoping this is a phase except also not really, because my mom gets super down when she gets into something new and it doesn&#8217;t work out.  It&#8217;s <em>unsettling.  </em>There are scenes in a lot of kids movies like it, where the family&#8217;s being weird, but when you&#8217;re living it, it&#8217;s&#8230; weird.  I&#8217;m explaining badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fine.  It makes me think of a nightmare.  Not like, terror, fear, all that, but one of the bad dreams that leaves you lying in bed, wondering why it bothered you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!  Exactly.  Except that&#8217;s my morning, probably every morning for the next while, and I&#8217;ve been talking about myself for <em>minutes</em> and I haven&#8217;t even asked how you are how are you?&#8221; Nora asked eyes widening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m- I&#8217;m-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got stuck in town for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I don&#8217;t even know where to begin.  I&#8217;m not good at explaining&#8230;&#8221; Avery trailed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounded like lots of family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery took the chance to get her phone out and stand next to Nora, flipping through to get to the photos of the family together for Thanksgiving dinner.  It let her stand next to her, her arm pressed against Nora&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Nora leaned in closer while Avery flipped through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that bad.  Like, usual family arguments and stuff, you know?  Dad&#8217;s taking care of Grumble- that&#8217;s Grumble.  Uncle Sean chips in some money sometimes, but only sometimes, and then he gets resistant to giving even a few hours of his time to taking over for a bit.  Dad&#8217;s peeved about it.  Apparently Aunt Clara had dibs on Uncle Sean or something and then Aunt Tracy got pregnant with Kyle in like, no time at all&#8230;&#8221;  Avery pointed out faces as she talked.  &#8220;But like, mostly normal.  Not like, your mom gritting her teeth, veins standing out in her neck and forehead from trying way too hard at yoga, and your brothers peeing themselves in glee from doing upward dog or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Downward.  And it&#8217;s not that bad, but what you&#8217;re describing is kinda closer to that than it is to &#8216;normal&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery leaned into Nora a little harder, which got Nora leaning back in the opposite way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You talked to your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It went okay,&#8221; Avery said.  She considered for a second, then said, &#8220;But my parents found out about some of the stuff my friends and I got up to before I left town, and it&#8217;s like, they aren&#8217;t super mad or anything, but they&#8217;re disappointed, and worried, and confused, and blaming themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of stuff is getting all those parent emotions?&#8221; Nora asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;m a bad person or anything, especially when I can&#8217;t tell you <em>everything</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.  I&#8217;d never think that,&#8221; Nora said, with an emphasis that caught Avery off guard.  Nora did the side-eye nervous thing again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But like&#8230;&#8221; Avery tried to find the words.  &#8220;People picked fights with us and we fought back.  And after my parents kinda let me down and weren&#8217;t paying attention to me, we found adults to confide in.  Mentors.  And my mom and Lucy&#8217;s mom were all, like, what if these people were abusing or exploiting us?  They wouldn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot to unpack and I&#8217;m barely scratching it but like&#8230; we kind of ran wild and our town was dying and there was so much crap happening and we just kind of&#8230; were around that.  Parties where screwed up things happened and stuff.  I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes sense why you were nervous about going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I guess.  Yeah,&#8221; Avery agreed.  &#8220;And going back, my friends are in the middle of it, and leaving, I&#8217;m leaving them in the middle of it.  I don&#8217;t want you to get the wrong idea about them.  They can be intense but they&#8217;re really cool.  I really want you to meet them someday.  I really really want that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora nodded.  &#8220;Do you want to go do something, talk about it some more?  I have ulterior motives, I want to spend time with you, catch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just motive?&#8221; Avery asked.  She studied Nora&#8217;s expression.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying no.  I really want to too.  But I might get called away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take what I can get.  If you get called away, video call me later?  Or is that too greedy?  Is that weird?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  It&#8217;s great.  Yes.  Or I can call later even if I don&#8217;t get called away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be greedy,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of me saying no, except when there&#8217;s other stuff I gotta do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we hang?  Somewhere we can be girlfriends instead of pretending to be friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora nodded.</p>
<p>It actually took a bit of time to find a good spot.  There were teenagers in the park and home wasn&#8217;t great, according to Snowdrop&#8217;s sense of Rowan hanging around.  Nora was pretty sure her family would be around.</p>
<p>Avery felt antsy by the time they finally found a spot in the woods alongside a bike trail. She wanted to kiss her, but went for a hug instead, self-conscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Missed you,&#8221; Nora said, hugging back tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we sat next to each other in class.  I wish we had more classes together.  I wish you could stay over,&#8221; Avery murmured.  &#8220;You talk about being greedy and I worry if I talked about how much I want to spend time with you I&#8217;d scare you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here.&#8221;</p>
<p>They kept hugging.  Avery saw the candy jewelry- a preserver candy that dangled from wire, maybe a bent paperclip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I eat your earring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got up early, rushed through my routine, then I was in the car eating snacks for hours, then school.  I worry my breath stinks.  Can I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was silly, but Avery took the candy in her teeth, biting with increasing pressure until it cracked in half, then took one half into her mouth, gently maneuvering the other part until it was free of the wire.  She pulled back, smiling, the one half sticking out from between her lips.  &#8220;Wan&#8217; haf?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora kissed Avery to take the other half.</p>
<p>The side of the path had a rock that was really only big enough for one of them.  They sat next to each other for about as long as Avery&#8217;s rear end could tolerate with what was basically a quarter-seat, before she had to give up and slide down to sit next to Nora&#8217;s feet, while Nora scooted over to take the rock for herself.  They both faced the same direction, watching through trees as some people did a practice or something with frisbees, past the bike path and in a patch of grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sophy asked me to try playing in a band she&#8217;s thinking of putting together,&#8221; Nora said.  &#8220;You know Sophy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the team?  For sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told her I drum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I not have told her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool.  Anyway.  She offered, and I figure I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be <em>so</em> cool.  Yes, for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be nice to have somewhere to play where I don&#8217;t feel pressured to stop if my neighbor gets home.  She says she and her cousin aren&#8217;t very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be awkward when you&#8217;re really good and they aren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m <em>really</em> good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see you make more music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Nora said.</p>
<p>Avery twisted sideways and looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You done that mint?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A while ago, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to suggest, you know.  Making out.  In a cool way, without saying it directly&#8230;&#8221; Nora said, squirming slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not good at this.  Flirting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, you&#8217;re good, I&#8217;m just a ditz.  It&#8217;s good,&#8221; Avery replied, sitting up.  She raised herself up.  &#8220;Let me make it up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, that sounded cool.  <em>You</em> can pull it off.  Effortlessly cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up and kiss me already,&#8221; Avery said, leaning in.</p>
<p>&#8220;That too.  Full body tingles here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shush!&#8221; Avery laughed, covering Nora&#8217;s mouth, then uncovering it as she leaned in further.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p>Avery kissed Nora, trying to put the message out of mind.  <em>No</em>.  <em>Not now.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p>Avery almost snarled in frustration as she pulled her phone out, checking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything okay?&#8221; Nora asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not you.  You&#8217;re great.  I&#8217;m getting called.&#8221;</p>
<p>No messages on the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have to go, or can you turn it off?&#8221; Nora asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t turn it off, I don&#8217;t think, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t-&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p>-have to go either.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p>Who was that?</p>
<p>Ann Wint?</p>
<p><em>Fuck</em> Ann Wint.</p>
<p>Avery stood up, texting Ann.  <em>Is this an emergency?</em></p>
<p>The reply came back:  <em>No.  But come anyway.</em></p>
<p>Avery typed back.  <em>No.  I have other plans.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p>Avery did her best to reach back emotionally across that channel, the same way she communicated with Snowdrop, to convey just how displeased she was with Ann.</p>
<p>Snowdrop, a short distance away, joined in with hissing signals.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly</em>.</p>
<p>She suppressed a sigh of annoyance.</p>
<p>Nora reached out, and grabbed one of Avery&#8217;s fingers in her hand.  She held on.  &#8220;You have to leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an emergency.  I don&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery turned, smiling.  And Nora was pulling on her hand, so she let her hand move, moving closer to her.  Nora pushed Avery&#8217;s sleeve up.  There was the arrangement of various bands, bracelets, and ornaments on Avery&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want?&#8221; Nora asked.  She held up the twist of ornamental wire that Avery had pulled the preserver candy from.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does it go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery considered the various options.  Friendship bracelet from Olivia, used when she awoke.  The bracelet from Verona.  The charm bracelet, the black rope, twisted around into an &#8216;8&#8217;, and so it went.</p>
<p>There was a ribbon she&#8217;d tied on as a whim.  It had been from flowers her dad had given her mom, keeping the bunch together, and she&#8217;d taken it.  Thinking of the Forest Ribbon Trail.</p>
<p>She chose that.  A bit of silvery wire twisted around the knot, decorating it.</p>
<p>A bit of silver lining to a dark cloud, maybe?  A nice reminder, maybe.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Avery Kelly.</em></p>
<p><em>Jesus Christ fuck me fuck her&#8230;</em></p>
<p>When Nora let go of her wrist, Avery put her hands on her shoulders.  &#8220;Distract me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure,&#8221; Nora replied.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Avery followed the <em>very</em> established connection all the way to a nice house in a nice neighborhood.  She stormed up the driveway, down the path, and knocked, ready to unload.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Avery&#8217;s fury was stifled in the face of a half-sized Ann Wint, Destroyer and Chainer.</p>
<p>Ann&#8217;s daughter, she belatedly realized.  The similarity was definitely there.  The girl was wearing a private school uniform, even though classes would have ended a while ago.  Avery couldn&#8217;t imagine wearing something like that and not changing at the first chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; the girl asked, in the tone of someone who had zero interest in offering help, and already thought Avery was far beneath her notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to your mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tiny Ann Wint looked very unimpressed.  But she motioned, and had Avery step inside before closing and locking the door.</p>
<p>It felt weird that the girl wasn&#8217;t shouting across the house like someone in Avery&#8217;s family would&#8217;ve.  Maybe because the house was <em>just</em> big enough that that was futile.</p>
<p>It was very nice, and very modern.  Open concept, white walls, lots of edges.  Glass between railing and stair.  A whole wall looking out on a pool in the backyard was more glass.</p>
<p><em>Probably hell to heat</em>, Avery thought.</p>
<p>Avery could hear conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get sixteen bottles, and if we need to we can bring some up from the cellar to supplement.  I know the people who&#8217;ll still be drinking late in the evening.  Some won&#8217;t care if we bring out swill, the others will appreciate finer vintage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I leave that to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a note, to remind me.  I&#8217;d normally remember, but with everything going on with my special projects&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know if I can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann audibly scoffed.  &#8220;You can&#8217;t, Jeffrey.  But it&#8217;s fine.  I think I&#8217;ll manage.  Will your friends be coming?  I know they drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother?&#8221; tiny Ann Wint asked, as she leaned into a doorway.  &#8220;A guest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Avery,&#8221; Avery called out, stepping to the side until she could see Ann through the door, along with a guy who was probably Ann&#8217;s husband.  The age seemed right.  Avery would&#8217;ve said he looked like a mildly attractive man with ten out of ten hair and ten out of ten clothes, but after Verona had thought Kyle and Jeremy were good looking, she wasn&#8217;t sure at all about the standards of straight girls and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intern?&#8221; Mr. Wint asked.  &#8220;From your special projects work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially.  She runs errands and messages for us sometimes.  Except for today.  I called, Avery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you called.  Repeatedly.  Rudely.  After I said to bug off, that if it wasn&#8217;t an emergency, I&#8217;d come later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some privacy?&#8221; Ann asked her husband.</p>
<p>He left the room, taking tiny Ann Wint away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Avery.  Shut the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery entered what turned out to be a study, shutting the heavy door behind her.  There was a kind of suction vacuum, with how close the door was to the floor, forming a perfect seal.</p>
<p>The inside was a mixture of white marble panels, cracked glass that was apparently supposed to be cracked, and matte black.  A swivel leather desk chair sat behind a desk that was the cracked glass panels holding up a slab of black wood, with papers spread out uniformly across all of it.  The laptop, even though it was large, looked tiny in that space.</p>
<p>Behind the desk was a half-bookshelf, with lots of tomes bound in what looked mostly like black leather.  The ones that weren&#8217;t black leather were on the bottom shelf, where they were partially obscured by the surrounding furniture.  Above that half bookshelf was an arrangement of old weapons, sorted so they formed a circle of radiating points.  All were blackened, damaged, tarnished darker with age, or mixed parts that had been polished with parts that had been allowed to degrade.  One of the axes near the top was broken, each separate piece mounted so it was in the approximate place it should be.</p>
<p>Avery paced.  &#8220;You go out of your way to re-bind your books in black leather for the aesthetic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?  No.  The practices I do, the assumption is black leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Edgy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gather you&#8217;re upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That feeling cuts both ways, Avery,&#8221; Ann said.  She moved behind her desk, looking at papers.  &#8220;I am astounded and bewildered by the fact you didn&#8217;t report directly to us at the first opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you the info by phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which isn&#8217;t nearly good enough.  We had a meeting.  It was the most convenient time for everyone involved.  I called so you could attend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow I&#8217;m not part of everyone?&#8221; Avery asked, heated.  &#8220;No.  Screw that.  You were <em>rude</em>.  You used magical connection name-calling practice to call my name over and over and I&#8217;ve read the damn Essentials text now.  It&#8217;s right there, in language spelled out for little kids who are about to learn the practice, <em>don&#8217;t do</em> <em>that!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s spelled out.  My daughter&#8217;s going to be awakened come winter.  I&#8217;ve been re-reviewing them, and editing a copy with details and notes appropriate to what I&#8217;ll be teaching her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this room soundproof?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.  I could murder a man here and my husband and children would be none the wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded to herself, taking that in, digesting, and trying to work her way back up to being pissed off enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at your fucking beck and call, Ann!&#8221; Avery raised her voice.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not your pet, I&#8217;m not your messenger or errand girl-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are.  You have run messages and errands both for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not <em>yours!  </em>I&#8217;m a messenger for Thunder Bay, not you!  I made the deal with Thunder Bay&#8217;s Lord, She Who Drowns in Moonlight!  Not you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d think you were trying to gainsay me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be right to,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s even in some of the Essentials books.  If you abuse certain privileges, you can get cursed, or lose karma.  Like calling people&#8217;s names.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Privileges are afforded based on power.  Those with more power, clout, and coup are in their rights to call on connections, and even abuse mechanisms like a called name as they see fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are <em>not</em> better than me, Ann,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t even think you&#8217;re stronger than me.  I&#8217;m not your intern, I&#8217;m not your messenger, I&#8217;m not your errand girl, I&#8217;m not your pet.  Don&#8217;t call me by saying my name three times unless it&#8217;s an emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a time of crisis, virtually everything&#8217;s an emergency by dint of the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been moving from crisis to crisis since Spring.  I call bullshit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think we aren&#8217;t in crisis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I dropped literally everything for every crisis, I wouldn&#8217;t get anything done.  You&#8217;re, what, planning a party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m planning an <em>event</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah well, I got stuff to do too.  I&#8217;m not at your fucking beck and call, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I&#8217;m acting Lord?&#8221; Ann asked, leaning over her desk, hands planted on its surface.</p>
<p>Avery frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord of Thunder Bay is healthy and well, I believe.  I wouldn&#8217;t worry.  But in her stead, I&#8217;m leading the council.  We just held one council meeting here.  Which you missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call B.S.,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About you as acting Lord.  Did the Lord of Thunder Bay actively assign the role to you?  Of acting Lord?  Special powers?  Privileges, sway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord of Thunder Bay rarely speaks, so she wouldn&#8217;t designate.  Much is left implied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she didn&#8217;t.  Even if she did?  We have a different relationship, Mrs. Wint.  If you   become Lord, I&#8217;ll renegotiate the terms of what I contribute to Thunder Bay with you then.  Until then?  No.  Fuck all the way off.  Don&#8217;t do that again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are <em>you</em> done?  Say it.  That you won&#8217;t call me like that again.  Not for a non-emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reserve the right to do what I must.  We are, as I stressed, in crisis, Ms. Kelly.  We <em>all</em> must contribute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck have you contributed in the last week, Ann?  Seriously?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;Seriously, let me know, because I was there, facing Musser down, I was there, countering one of his last big Lordship claims.  I was there, when most of his guys that weren&#8217;t sitting around being Lords showed the fuck up in my town!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann raised her eyebrows slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you even read my fucking emails!?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I perused.  It&#8217;s hard to say what is hyperbole in text and what is not, and I didn&#8217;t want to call attention to exaggeration.  Digital media may be less watched by the spirits but they nonetheless will notice if you give them cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t exaggerating!  There were seventy practitioners, Ann!  Some pretty important ones too!  I just left my friends behind dealing with Anthem fucking Tedd.  I left them!  That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing tonight!  Without me!  And I&#8217;m here because if I&#8217;m going to hold the tatters of my actual life and family together- they made my parents aware, Ann!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t involve you in my family issues, do the same for me.  If you held-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!  No, because I&#8217;m making a point here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you held your own against the kind of numbers and power you describe, that&#8217;s impressive.  Can I continue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, because I&#8217;m fucking continuing I was talking, pay attention to what I&#8217;m saying!  I&#8217;ve been in the thick of it!  And I just got back, I just got part of a day to go to school and catch back up on life, to chill, to enjoy people I enjoy, and what do you do?  You shit all over it!  You pull this stupid crap that fucking ten and twelve year old practitioners know not to do because it&#8217;s in the most basic rules for practitioners!  Fuck you for interrupting my limited time with cool people with your rude shit.  I&#8217;ve been in the thick of it.  What have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann sat down in her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Held down the fort in the absence of our Lord, so to speak.  She is trying to find a way forward, reaching out elsewhere, I&#8217;m trying to make sure her seat is still here when she gets back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any immediate attacks?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s bull.  You want me and my time?  Schedule me.  Ask nicely by email.  Don&#8217;t call me like I&#8217;m a dog of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it prevent another repeat outburst like the one you&#8217;re having now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;If you don&#8217;t agree not to do it again, I&#8217;m liable to use my words and even possibly an Oath, not to listen to you or acknowledge you.  I&#8217;m pretty sure I can block your metaphorical number by doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do that, I&#8217;ll get to the council, declare you uncooperative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on out there, on the metaphorical freaking field, I&#8217;ve been dealing with Charles and Musser, I helped found a Lost realm last weekend.  I raced through a ton of Paths.  I&#8217;ve made friends and networked those friends with the wider practitioner community.  If people here want to deal with the Carmine Exile?  And they have to choose between you and me?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;I think they pick me.  If they want to deal with Musser?  I think they pick me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to make this gamble, knowing it could mean you&#8217;re not allowed in Thunder Bay&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; Avery said.  She approached the desk, standing over it, hands spread out and flat on the surface, like Ann had been earlier.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t go there.  If you even <em>hint</em> at that threat, that&#8217;s it for us.  I won&#8217;t have that hanging over my head.  Not after working my ass off and putting everything on the line.  Not when my family- my parents, they&#8217;re stressing, they&#8217;re struggling, they&#8217;re part of this now.  I&#8217;ve sacrificed.  If you try to hold that over me, I&#8217;ll-&#8221; Avery struggled for a good finisher.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you regret it, Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann leaned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please apologize,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;For calling me like you did.  And for the threat just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t often apologize, as a personal rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously.  Anything a practitioner says or does contributes to patterns and spiritual expectations.  Apologies <em>give</em>, they breed a weakness, and with forces I wield, I don&#8217;t want any chinks in my armor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221; Avery asked, again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll amend my stance.  I won&#8217;t call you again.  I won&#8217;t threaten your family.  But I do need your assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d know if you attended the meeting,&#8221; Ann said, standing.  &#8220;We investigated what you described.  Nothing about Franky.  We wondered about the goat, but the goat is harder to interview and analyze.  Nothing turns up to Sight or our diagnostics.  We don&#8217;t have a strong shaman to call out the spirit of the goat in a form like your familiar- one that could talk and work with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Well&#8230; my source seemed credible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Carmine Exile seemed credible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Then we&#8217;re stumped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles seemed to design his Lords to be counters and tricks.  He made this one, apparently, to deal with a situation like Florin Pesch taking over the Lordship, giving that Lordship over to someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Florin would have left after.  It&#8217;s not him specifically.  We don&#8217;t know who would&#8217;ve been Lord?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raquel Musser was named.  Florin thought he could negotiate that.  But it didn&#8217;t sound certain, and that happened after Franky and her goat showed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.  Maybe it&#8217;s not a counter?  Something more general?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something, if I had to guess, that works on a level that nobody in Thunder Bay can really answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit has already come up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm, true.  What diagnostics did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On Franky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or the goat.  Or both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For both, we did a quick card reading.  Not a strength but Sourav manages.  Some of the same tricks we all use for item identification.  Nothing stand-out.  Analysis under Sight, nothing.  Nadine, Dav, and Jason from the Glean Team wanted to kill it and study the remains.  We were worried something might be nestled inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the worst possible something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Demon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery raised her eyebrows and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  There are myths, a prized horse, killed, turned out to be the prized steed of a god, earned a god&#8217;s wrath.  We debated it, and decided it&#8217;s better to leave alone.  Or, more precisely, we debated killing Franky Reiber, which upset some of the tertiary council members, and they got stubborn enough to refuse even killing the goat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah well, I might&#8217;ve been on their side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As is, we&#8217;ve pooled instruments together.  Thea was kind enough to provide a great number of quality instruments.  Nadine brought over some measuring tools.  Sourav had some.  We have people keeping constant eye on each of the instruments.  Taking turns.  If something goes wrong, if the levels of echoes rise, scales tip, or cards start agitating, they&#8217;re to call for help immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at a loss.  We considered sending them away, but that could be the trap.  Franky was upset at the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she lived here most her life, if I remember right.  And there&#8217;s kind of a lot of monsters in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Ann said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a sign of anything, except that she&#8217;s human.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At which point we&#8217;re still at a loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.  Alcazar?  Turn the woman or the goat into a place, go into the place, see what turns up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know someone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me.  We did one with the Carmine Furs, a bit ago.  Trying to figure out who killed the Carmine Beast.  Learned a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is similar to us expecting there to be a bomb inside a package.  And you intend to dive into the package, amid wires and buttons?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess, yeah.  Do you have better ideas?  Or do you want to keep this as a thing hanging over our heads for a long while?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be our best option, and it&#8217;s not a good one.  Would you be willing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I could do better than a lot of people.  But I&#8217;d need support.  And help, I think.  In case it gets nasty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d <em>want</em> my friends from back home.  But I guess if I had to choose&#8230; ugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery thought through the various residents of Thunder Bay.  Most of the ones she liked were gone now.</p>
<p>There was one answer, but Avery had a borderline phobia around the man.  Still&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugggh.  Odis?  He knows pocket realms.  He&#8217;s done the thing with his bus line.  His practice gets into the blackforest stuff, with the gingerbread house realms that you go into.  Some of that applies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s liable to send Thea in his stead.  If you want an expert in localized realms, she would be a top choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;d be a disaster, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her to cooperate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your orders don&#8217;t matter as much as you seem to think they do.  Again, I think it&#8217;d be a disaster.  I&#8217;d rather go alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to them.  I&#8217;ll get back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery sighed, shaking her head.</p>
<p>She walked across the office, looking at the art.  Lots of paintings of ruins, some almost calligraphy-like, black ink on white paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Lords did you run into?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I put it all in the Black Box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymond Sunshine&#8217;s big crisis tracker?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t use that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the hell not?  It&#8217;s kind of made for this kind of situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clunky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is not in my suite of interests or concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like you&#8217;re at war, queen of a castle, enemy at the gates, and thousands of lives depend on you thinking of a synonym to truce.  And in this metaphor, you won&#8217;t pick up a damn thesaurus.  That&#8217;s dumb, Ann,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Come on.  Don&#8217;t be a dink.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last word seemed to raise Ann&#8217;s hackles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a dink,&#8221; Avery repeated.  &#8220;Use the program.  Seriously.  I&#8217;ll cut the giant lady made of water some slack for not knowing computers or data tracking or whatever but <em>come on</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a look later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Look for the possibly Abyssal Pay Phone and the lady and her gigaphantom.  Apparently they&#8217;re shuffling around.  Some moved to other locations because Musser and his core group are out there, problem solving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann raised an eyebrow.  &#8220;Abyssal Pay Phone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.  &#8220;It may be a Ruined Pay Phone.  I know your whole deal is dual mastery of the Abyss stuff and Ruined stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But also, like, back to what I said before?  These are traps, I think.  And if it seems like it&#8217;s <em>just your thing</em>, it might be a trap the Carmine Exile wants to use to take out a really strong practitioner.  You.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s technomancy, and if you&#8217;re so bad with tech you can&#8217;t navigate the Black Box-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can navigate it.  I just haven&#8217;t had the time or inclination,&#8221; Ann said, testy now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatever else I might think of you, you&#8217;re strong, it could be a trap.  So&#8230; keep that in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>Ann straightened, rubbing at one shoulder.  &#8220;I should get ready for dinner with my family.  And I have an event to plan with my husband.  I&#8217;ll be in touch about Thea joining you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Odis.  Not Thea.  Seriously.  Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him, I know them, I know he&#8217;ll ask Thea to go.  He isn&#8217;t nimble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you might have to get someone else to go diving into a lady and her goat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see.  I&#8217;ll be in touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>Ann went to the door, opened it, and held it for Avery.  Then she walked Avery to the door.</p>
<p>Tiny Ann Wint and her younger sister were at the dinner table, with their father looking over their shoulders as they did homework.  They looked up at Avery and their mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awakening the older one?&#8221; Avery asked, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the intention.  I may change my mind, depending on what happens in the meantime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of a crazy world to awaken a kid into.  Bad situation, too.  It&#8217;s like, I want to have kids one day, a lot of them, but what kind of world is this to bring kids into, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought the same thing when I was little.  The cold war was back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always a crisis,&#8221; Avery said, quiet.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an answer though.  It&#8217;s <em>worse</em>, when you think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  She&#8217;s capable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s what, nine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s capable enough, Avery,&#8221; Ann stressed.  &#8220;She&#8217;ll do well.  She&#8217;s my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send me the information on the Alcazar ritual as soon as you&#8217;re available.  I&#8217;ll review it before we do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>She went home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey skates,&#8221; Rowan said, as Avery came up the stairs.  &#8220;We ordered in.  There&#8217;s vegetarian stuff for you.  But it&#8217;s cold by now, so you&#8217;ll have to nuke it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  I&#8217;ll get that after.  Where&#8217;s Mom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom&#8217;s on the patio, I think she&#8217;s all familied out, after last weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>She&#8217;s wiped out for other reasons</em>, Avery thought.  She already knew her mom was on the patio.</p>
<p>She let herself through the door and stepped outside.  It was pretty crisp out, now.  A sweatshirt wasn&#8217;t enough to stay out for the long term.  Her breath fogged.</p>
<p>Her mom was wearing her jacket and boots, and sat in a patio chair, looking up at the sky.  A blanket was on her lap, and Snowdrop was hidden away in the blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been keeping me company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been giving her scratches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.  We&#8217;re bonded.  I can feel what she feels.  I know you&#8217;ve been giving her treats,&#8221; Avery said.  She poked at the side of Snowdrop&#8217;s tummy.</p>
<p>Snowdrop rolled onto her back, limbs spread out.</p>
<p>&#8220;In your text, you said you were talking to Ann?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean much to me.  I don&#8217;t understand all the terms yet.  Or who the people are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, uh.  Well, she thinks she&#8217;s in charge but she&#8217;s not.  She was pestering me, wanting updates.  I told her where to get my updates, we talked about situations.  In a couple nights I&#8217;ll be penetrating a woman and her goat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The joke didn&#8217;t really land, or get the reaction that would let Avery move on to clarifying.  Her mom was silent, just looking worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using magic to turn them into a place.  Then going in, seeing what turns up.  I&#8217;ll probably have backup.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Even if the likely backup is worse than no backup at all</em>.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t add that, out of concern that it&#8217;d make her mom more stressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to keep myself from losing my mind with worry when you&#8217;re gone,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know either,&#8221; Avery admitted.  &#8220;If there was real trouble, Snowdrop would&#8217;ve reacted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she can&#8217;t stay with me every time you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  I need her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you checked your texts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used magic to get around, I figured I&#8217;d catch up on everything when I got back.  Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jasmine called.  Lucy went to the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s heart did an ugly tumble in her chest.  She pulled out her phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;She fought America and Anthem Tedd.  Jasmine&#8217;s sick over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery sorted through her messages.  Nothing recent from Lucy, that was bad.</p>
<p>Verona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona says they won.  Lucy&#8217;s pretty battered but she&#8217;ll be okay,&#8221; Avery noted.  &#8220;That&#8217;s, hmmm, a pretty good outcome, considering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom looked up at her, the look in her eyes almost <em>wounded.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hurt enough for her mom to want her to go to the hospital.  This is a registered nurse, someone who knows what she&#8217;s doing.  And that&#8217;s a victory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not happy Lucy&#8217;s hurt.  But she&#8217;s going to be okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if that&#8217;s a victory, sweetie, then what does a loss look like?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Like Gabriel.  Like Reagan.  Like us getting kicked out of the Blue Heron and Musser taking power.  Like echoes and wraiths invading the town.  Like my friends getting hurt.  Like losing friends to betrayal.  Like losing John.  Like Charles becoming Carmine.</em></p>
<p>Something unacceptable, in short.  Like <em>everything</em> that was unacceptable, as the stakes got higher.</p>
<p>The right answer was damning, but the silence wasn&#8217;t any better, and there sure felt like there was a <em>lot</em> of silence.</p>

<p><em>Twenty seven days.  Have to make it to thirty</em>.</p>
<p><em>Then forty-five.  Then sixty.</em></p>
<p><em>Fighting.</em></p>
<p>Liberty screamed in the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t like this blanket, Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, War, put your sword to my throat.  If we happen to be in a situation where we need all three blankets, we can put that one between the two others- <em>three</em> others if we count the one packed away in the back, you shouldn&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coarse and it prickles.  Even through other blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The screaming changed pitches.  Designed by Nature in her myriad facets to grate the nerves and test patience, to make the parent act on the child&#8217;s needs.  Screaming, like a drill at the tooth.</p>
<p>Nature couldn&#8217;t make a way to shut ears in the same way they shut eyes?</p>
<p>&#8220;My great aunt made it-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is one of the reasons I don&#8217;t burn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-Consider it a symbol more than anything we&#8217;re ever going to use.  A bit of heritage and family.  Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vicky approached Anthem and lightly took hold of his collar with both hands.  She feigned a smile.  &#8220;Get another one from the linen cupboard.  Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had responses he wanted to give.  The screaming continued in the background.  America shouted something.  He laid his hands over Vicky&#8217;s and pressed down until they went flat, pressed between his upper chest and his own.  He forced a smile.  &#8220;Yes dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And see to Liberty?  I&#8217;ve been checking on her all morning, I think she thinks something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something <em>is</em> wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  You&#8217;re taking a vacation for once.  It&#8217;s such upheaval and disturbance in routine to that little mind.  A foreign concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his great aunt&#8217;s blanket and carried it over to the linen cupboard, re-folding it with care.  &#8220;Our trip takes us close to Sheila and Glenn&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you give me a <em>bit</em> of leeway?&#8221; he asked from the hallway, frustrated now.  The screaming-  &#8220;A thirty minute conversation.  They&#8217;ll give us lunch.  It&#8217;s a better space for the kids to take a break from the car than any roadside stop, I know Sheila likes the <i>Kanabō </i>whiskey.  A bottle of that, we wouldn&#8217;t owe them anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  They&#8217;re unsettling.  There&#8217;s something missing in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped in the doorway, a different blanket in his arms.  &#8220;That is the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want that around our daughters.  Not for thirty minutes.  Not for&#8230; however long.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;God dammit!&#8221; </em>he raised his voice.  &#8220;Vicky-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, firm, intense.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout while the girls can hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty howled in the background.</p>
<p>He controlled his volume.  &#8220;Give me something.  Anything.  Do you have to make this a struggle every step of the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and me, the girls, we&#8217;re packing everything we need up, we&#8217;re getting in the car, we&#8217;re going to drive for hours while listening to mind numbing songs about dinosaurs and princesses, until the girls fall asleep, then we&#8217;ll listen to music on a low volume the rest of the way.  We&#8217;ll get to the beach, we&#8217;ll have a fucking vacation, Anthem, for once, we&#8217;ll spend the night, spend the day, and then we drive back with a pair of sandy, sleepy little girls.  No fucking detours, no cyclical fucking arguments, and no prickly fucking blankets.  Just happy fucking family memories.  Fucking <em>please</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>He exhaled slowly through his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you please check on your baby daughter and make sure a strangeling isn&#8217;t knifing her in her crib?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one strangeling in the neighborhood, it didn&#8217;t even approach the house,&#8221; he said, as he left the room.  &#8220;Seeing me scared it off.  There&#8217;s been no signs of another in the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty screeched, and didn&#8217;t even pause for a moment as she saw him, or when he picked her up.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s crying!&#8221; America declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m well aware,&#8221; Anthem replied, raising his voice over the sound.  &#8220;Pick up your toys, please.  Busy busy, work fast, work hard.  Don&#8217;t have a nap until we&#8217;re in the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sleep wough <em>that!&#8221; </em>America said, mocking an expression.  There was a word in that sentence that made it sound like she&#8217;d tried to say with and through and blended them together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toys in the bin, hurry hurry,&#8221; he said, bouncing Liberty in his arms, padded diaper braced against a forearm, hand steadying her upper body.</p>
<p>America got busy with the task.</p>
<p>He leaned Liberty against his upper body, shifting into deeper, rumbly tones, &#8220;Toys in the bin, hurry, hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usually that helped settle her down.  Not today.  Liberty groped at the air, pausing in the screaming to make inarticulate sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom is cranky, so let&#8217;s leave her alone and let her pack,&#8221; he told Liberty, but she was already screaming again.</p>
<p>Anthem got in America&#8217;s way as she went back and forth, very inefficiently putting things away.  He made it worse, becoming an obstacle, putting a leg out to trip her.  All in good fun- he caught her when she actually did trip, moving shin against stomach.  She liked the challenge of it.  She grabbed his pants leg to steady herself as she moved around him.</p>
<p>Liberty pitched her scream higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>What</em> is going on with you?&#8221; he asked.  He checked her backside.  &#8220;Diaper?  Nope.  I know you ate.  Stomach too full?  Nope.  Ohhh, this is going to be a quote-unquote &#8216;fun&#8217; car ride, I can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fun!?&#8221; America asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be <em>something</em>, I&#8217;m sure.  And then we&#8217;ll be at the <em>beach!  </em>When&#8217;s the last time you were at the beach?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reamber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t remember?  Ohhh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty&#8217;s little fist grabbed at his shirt.  <em>Just like your mom just now</em>, he thought, and he smiled.  She screamed in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you grow up to rail against your enemies with half the fury you&#8217;re displaying now, that&#8217;ll do you nicely,&#8221; he told Liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that mean?&#8221; America asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She <em>is</em> mad,&#8221; America replied.</p>
<p>He put Liberty back in the crib.  &#8220;Finish putting your room away, and then pick out a bathing suit from your closet.  <em>Not</em> the yellow one.  That one&#8217;s too small.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone?  Ohh.  Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mom throw it out?&#8221;</p>
<p>America nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Pick out another then,&#8221; he said, stroking her tousled blonde hair a few times, trying to pat it down into some semblance of order.</p>
<p>He collected some things from the bathroom and went back into his room.</p>
<p>Vicky lay face down across one of the luggage cases.</p>
<p>He almost dropped the bathroom things on the floor, then thought twice, depositing them onto one of the open cases, before dropping down to his knees on the floor next to her.  &#8220;Vicky.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was nonresponsive- and not as warm to the touch as he took hold of her head and neck.  Maintaining his grip on her neck, he moved her onto her back- not easy, even when he was strong and she was thin.  He brushed hair out of the way and checked her eyes.  One was bloodshot.  He checked airway-</p>
<p>On the third chest compression, he felt ribs break.</p>
<p>Taking it to thirty felt like brutalizing her.  He kept careful count, and it was the only thought that could occupy his head with the rest of the dull noise there.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he panted out the word, before breathing air into her lungs.  He watched her chest rise, then leaned back, gasping in air, watching it sink.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d given them six months.  There would be symptoms in the meanwhile, they&#8217;d said.</p>
<p>He breathed air into her lungs again.</p>
<p>The plan had been to take it to thirty days, best they could, reassess, then take it to forty-five.  Then sixty.  All the way to one hundred and eighty.</p>
<p>They hadn&#8217;t even reached thirty before issues?  What the hell was that?</p>
<p>He started the brutal, rib-grating chest compressions again.</p>
<p>Liberty continued to wail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy!&#8221; America called out.  &#8220;I want my mermaid tail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s packed!&#8221; he shouted.  He looked over his shoulder, and abandoned the compressions just long enough to get up, slam the door, almost in America&#8217;s face, just before she could step over and see.  He locked it.  &#8220;Go to your room, okay, honey?&#8221;</p>
<p>He resumed the compressions.</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t let the end of us be a shitty little argument</em>.  <em>Come back</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you mad, daddy!?&#8221; America shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad, honey!&#8221; he shouted, grunting out the words.  &#8220;Go to your room!  I love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t one of the symptoms they&#8217;d said to expect.  A sudden and immediate end, no warning.</p>
<p>He reached thirty and breathed for her again.</p>
<p>Somewhere in those thirty quick compressions, this went from an issue they could come back from to a certainty.  Nothing was changing.  She wasn&#8217;t responding.  She wasn&#8217;t warming- just the opposite.</p>
<p><em>Come back for five seconds.  Enough I can say something kind.<br />
</em></p>
<p>He stopped, and went for her bag, pulling clothes out.  There were pill bottles- but that wasn&#8217;t everything.  Where was it?  Where was it?  She had to have packed it.</p>
<p>Had she put it in his bag, instead?  A petty move to make his bag a fraction heavier?</p>
<p>He pulled out all the clothes, searching.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He got up, unlocked the door, and stepped out into the hall.  America was looking just past the door.  Liberty wailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay in your room, America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bathroom cupboard.  A nice engraved box.  He popped it open.</p>
<p>Three vials, no fluid.  Healing draughts, empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were supposed to tell me!&#8221; he roared.  &#8220;If you used them, you were supposed to tell me so I could get more!&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached her side again, beginning the compressions, because he didn&#8217;t know what else to do, and maybe it could buy a fraction of a second if he could think of something.</p>
<p>A shitty fucking argument over a wool blanket and a detour.  Her patience low because she was dying.  His patience low because she wouldn&#8217;t fucking consider options.</p>
<p>A fight and a struggle for the alchemy.  She wouldn&#8217;t talk to Sheila and Glenn.  She wouldn&#8217;t talk to Eliana.  No shamans, no medical doctors.  She&#8217;d been tired of being sick for years, tired of any number of things that only postponed, only partially fixed.  They hadn&#8217;t had the resources that real solutions would take, and she&#8217;d wanted any money they had left to go toward investing in the kids, and in memories.  She&#8217;d wanted to breastfeed Liberty.</p>
<p>He eventually stopped the compressions, and hugged her upper body to his.</p>
<p>Liberty&#8217;s screaming stopped.  The light in the room got unbearably bright as the light cloud cover parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the time.  It had been hours.  How had it been hours?</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we go?  Beach today.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put Vicky down, and then picked himself up off the ground.  He&#8217;d been in fights, but he felt more battered from kneeling in one position, and from the exertion.</p>
<p>He unlocked and opened the door, and scooped up America, closing the door behind him.  Then he got Liberty, who&#8217;d cried herself to sleep.  She didn&#8217;t protest much as he gathered her up in his other arm.</p>
<p>He took them outside, leaving the door open behind him, and settled each into their car seats.  He&#8217;d planned to go back to the house to close the door behind him, but now that he was the thirty feet away, he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to venture closer.  He sorted them out, no bags, no things for a stay elsewhere, double-checking the car seats were secure.</p>
<p>He pulled out, driving through the secluded forest routes, and got his cell phone.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know who to call.</p>
<p>There was no &#8216;best&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, dinosaur song!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After.  Let me call a friend,&#8221; he said.  He chose the closest person.  &#8220;Quiet, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthem Tedd,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A.J.  I left the front door open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re close, aren&#8217;t you?  To my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I think so, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left the front door open.  I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could send someone.  Close up the place.  Look after-&#8221; he stopped.  He could see America in her car seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.  I consider myself pretty clever, but I don&#8217;t follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vicky.  I&#8217;m not in a position to manage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s- oh.  Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls are in the car.  Don&#8217;t say anything more than that.  I won&#8217;t return to that house.  If you could send someone to close it up and take care of Vicky&#8217;s affairs, the first steps, I can handle the rest.  I&#8217;ll pay you back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go myself.  You don&#8217;t owe me anything.  Do you want the place sorted?  Books and things?  To be delivered wherever you end up?  I could even arrange for it to be sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. All of that.  Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to it.  Tedd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Musser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I need to worry?  About you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Anthem decided.  He looked in the rear-view mirror at the girls.  America impatient, Liberty dozing, red-faced.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the girls to look after.  Taking them to the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call, okay?  If you still don&#8217;t know, later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Hanging up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A.J. Musser&#8217;s response was cut off by Anthem hitting the plastic button on the heavy duty cell phone.  He put the music on, but he also opened his window, letting the rush of wind drown out most of it.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t brought anything.</p>
<p>They could play naked on the beach.  They were little.  They could buy clothes and anything else they needed.  There would be mermaid tails and things for sale at places along the way.</p>
<p>His head pounded, probably from dehydration.  He&#8217;d cried himself dry, holding his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, honey?&#8221; he asked.  Every word had to be measured, so it could pierce the hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Why would I be mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look mad at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved the rear view mirror, and saw his own eyes.</p>
<p>With the hurt was an anger.  That much was clear in the redness, the lines around his eyes, and the long stare.</p>
<p>That it felt like she&#8217;d given up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;So you want to do this.  Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at him, glaring past the eyeholes of her fox mask.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ll at least respect your tenacity enough to not hold back</em>.</p>
<p>He drew his gun on the Ellingson girl.  A ward at her shoulder glowed through the minute gaps in her sweater, and the smooth movement of the gun was stalled- a pressure, like pushing into denser air.</p>
<p>Her hand went up, pushing his hand up and away, and between the hand and the pushback of the anti-metal ward, she had the momentary advantage.</p>
<p>He stepped back and away- and she didn&#8217;t let him, moving in close, drawing something from her pocket.  A gray marker with a gold cap.</p>
<p>It transformed- becoming a trident, gold-brass head, gray shaft.  Wicked points aimed at his chest.</p>
<p>He ignored it, reaching a hand out for the points.</p>
<p>She shifted her stance, aiming the trident not for him, but for the gun.  He wasn&#8217;t surprised.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t have that kind of killer instinct.  It was a feint, trying to scare him, buying herself the opportunity to catch the end of the gun in between the tines of the trident.  He was already pulling the gun back, elbow as bent as he could manage it, twisting his body, ready to fire past his chest and outstretched arm to her.</p>
<p>He reached for her, and she moved, turning her back to him as she rotated around the very end of the trident, keeping the shaft between them, to block his reaching hand.</p>
<p>He went to grab the shaft, stopping just in time as the trident became a lengthy curved scimitar.  She looked back past her own shoulder and moved the tip of the scimitar to the tip of the barrel.</p>
<p>Lengthy scimitar became lengthy rapier, the tip remaining positioned where it was, to thrust directly into the barrel.  She ducked down, and the fragile, needle-thin blade broke off inside the barrel.</p>
<p>From the duck, she dropped to all fours, wavering slightly-</p>
<p>Was she hurt from earlier?  Or had that practice of weapon changing taken something out of her?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t matter.  He took advantage of the moment of weakness and kicked.  She twisted around and caught his foot, gripping it for balance even as she forfeited it elsewhere.  She only managed to push the foot as it came at her, thrusting herself away rather than take the direct hit, falling again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d rather fight me than face her and talk to her?&#8221; Ellingson asked, as she got to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but fighting you is closer to being nothing than it is to changing my mind,&#8221; Anthem admitted.</p>
<p>She straightened.  He shook the gun, seeing if it would dislodge anything caught inside, or at least produce a meaningful rattle.  When it didn&#8217;t, he aimed it at her and pulled the trigger.  She chose that same moment to touch her shoulder, turning it toward him.</p>
<p>The gun jarred in his hand, more than it should, and no bullet was produced.  The ward she&#8217;d touched wasn&#8217;t even necessary.</p>
<p>He could smell burned plastic.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you unwilling to change your mind?  Is it cowardice or stupidity?&#8221; Ellingson asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Years of experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like it&#8217;s both cowardice and stupidity.  Experience means listening to the people that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to talk to me or are you going to fight?  Because if you&#8217;re not going to fight, let&#8217;s call this now and go our own separate ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love your daughters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupid question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why won&#8217;t you listen to them!?  You won&#8217;t listen to them, you won&#8217;t listen to us, you shoot a bunch of innocents like they&#8217;re nothing, and the only person you seem to care about is Abraham fucking Musser.  There&#8217;s something really fucking wrong with this picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the picture doesn&#8217;t include you, and you weren&#8217;t invited to view it.  Tedd family affairs have next to nothing to do with you.  Walk away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What family?  Those kids deserve so much better than you.  You were going to bind Toadswallow?  And you don&#8217;t even realize how fucked that is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a different goblin then, I was a different man, the girls needed him.  I thought it was a decent compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get a say in that compromise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left.  A shame it didn&#8217;t do more to shatter their illusions about what the goblin and goblins are about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear yourself!?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached into his coat, and watched the girl tense.  Pulling out a card, he touched it to the gun, unraveling it into a series of dark lines.  It became a dark, inky sketch on the card, with words surrounding it, describing its state and various details of the weapon, including how recently he&#8217;d acquired it and the care he&#8217;d given it.  He could angle the card and let the scribbled, barely-legible text drift across the surface, giving other information.  It would need a good clean, with plastic caught in the rifling and mechanism.</p>
<p>With a movement, he put the card away and drew out two new ones.  The magic diagrams inlaid on the weapon were visible on the cards.</p>
<p>What was his best bet?  To try to overcome the strength of the diagram with his own raw power, a penetrative shot, or to aim for quantity and see if there was a gap?</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to put out this fire?&#8221; Mr. Martin asked, behind him.</p>
<p>The wooden telephone pole was burning, and flecks were falling onto the hood of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  If you would, Mr. Martin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott.  It&#8217;ll get us out of here faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem could see through the corner of his eye as Scott inhaled the smoke from the fire, then exhaled- and in the same way that the fog of Anthem&#8217;s breath appeared with every exhalation, curling and dissipating through the air, the smoke turned to spiders, many buoyed aloft by hot air.</p>
<p>The man blew harder, and all smoke became spiders, more dying in the flames- but that became an edge of black flecks that overtook the flame.  Even the glowing edges of the wood turned black, then the black became spreading masses of spider.</p>
<p>Anthem saw Ellingson shift her footing slightly away.  A moment of distraction, her eyes on Scott Martin.</p>
<p>His card became a gun.  The way she&#8217;d turned her shoulder toward him, the defense wasn&#8217;t absolute.  There might be gaps, and he knew the practitioners of this town had a lot of power behind them.</p>
<p>It was easier to get around that protection than to circumvent it.</p>
<p>She threw herself to the ground, casting out some glamour as she did.  A flash-</p>
<p>He was protected against that much.</p>
<p>And glowing fox forms darted out- four and a half.  One didn&#8217;t fully form and didn&#8217;t move far.  Each moved in a separate direction.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t even move the gun, but instead, hand on the slide of the pistol, touched a specific pattern of runes, feeling them warm under fingertips.</p>
<p>Sixteen.  Dividing the one bullet into sixteen, each with one sixteenth the ability to harm.  Which remained more than enough.  He looked down the sight with his Sight, and the scene split into sixteen fragments he could track all at once.</p>
<p>He aimed and fired.</p>
<p>Three light-foxes shot down, and the half light-fox executed where it was still floundering.  The fourth sprinted around his flank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that cheating in spirit, Ellingson?  It&#8217;s not four shells with a ball under one.  It&#8217;s four shells and the one I pick last is the one with the ball?&#8221;</p>
<p>She passed behind a roadside streetlight, and he saw the lighting change by the smallest amount as the light-fox darted through.  Its texture changed, making the light more of an outline, the dark parts of it little more than the darkness that was already behind it.  He shot it, scattering the glamour, and wasn&#8217;t shocked when Lucy wasn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Shadow had separated from light, light carrying on, and shadow had gone up.  To the top of the streetlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has a drawback,&#8221; he declared, for the benefit of the spirits.</p>
<p>He touched spots on the slide of the pistol.  <em>Thirty.</em></p>
<p>She split into three shadowy figures, jumping down toward him.</p>
<p>He shot them without needing to aim.  Each was hit by two or three bullets.  At this degree of division, each would feel like being hit with a backhanded swing of a swung crowbar, pointed end digging in.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t even look particularly hard to see which ones were glamour, and what the real Ellingson&#8217;s trajectory was.  He put a hand in position, let her land between him and the car, stumbling slightly, hand to her chest, and then slammed his forearm into her neck, shoving her into the vehicle.</p>
<p>He was mildly surprised when she fought back faster and harder than he&#8217;d anticipated, but he got control of her and shoved her back again.  He dismissed the gun, putting the card away.</p>
<p>&#8220;When there isn&#8217;t a clear final shell with the ball beneath, the universe, in all her penchant for fairness, is going to hand your enemy the ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>She coughed.</p>
<p>Her hand moved.  He reached over to catch it, and leaned in harder.  &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her other hand moved, and he brought his knee up, leaning in, knee at her armpit, where it caught the red sweater she wore, his leg blocking her access to her pockets and belt.  Her fingernails scratched at his jeans, groped.</p>
<p>He leaned in harder.</p>
<p>The window next to Ellingson&#8217;s head rolled down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>Cyn, just inside, stopped it there.  &#8220;Do you need help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like I need help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making the offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do want to help, I think the local Others are about a minute or two behind.  Watch out for the Oni in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get too far from the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyn and Mark Cavendar got out of the car and headed down the street.</p>
<p>He turned his full attention to the gasping girl.  She struggled, her sweater producing a metal-on-metal screech.  That would explain the bullets not slowing her down that much..</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; he urged her.  &#8220;Good effort.  I like the multidisciplinary approach.  I like that weapon transformation technique enough I&#8217;d even trade you for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was flushed, each breath a struggle.  He could have choked her out better with a change in position, but he wasn&#8217;t about to forfeit the advantage he had now.  It would risk her slipping away.</p>
<p>Her hand gripped his elbow, fingernails trying to dig past the sleeve of his jacket.  She pulled down, trying to give herself reprieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go down.  I won&#8217;t kill you while you&#8217;re passed out.  I&#8217;ll leave you by the side of the road, I&#8217;ll call Cyn and Mark back, and your Others can collect you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her head, fingernails scraping at his sleeve.  The metal of her sweater scraping against the car door gave away the fact she was making tiny amounts of progress in moving her hand.</p>
<p>And with the turn of her head, the nose of her fox mask grazed her fingers.</p>
<p>It transformed, muscles moving beneath the mask&#8217;s surface as it turned into one of the oldest weapons.  A fanged mouth opened, saliva strung between teeth.</p>
<p>He pushed himself away, narrowly avoiding having a chunk taken out of his arm.  He kicked her in the stomach as a parting gesture, which made her double over.</p>
<p>She took too long to recuperate.  The lack of oxygen and whatever it cost her to make those transformations added up, her one arm didn&#8217;t look like it had a lot of strength, and a heavy kick to her midsection took some of the fight out of her.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>She made a sound &#8211; a strangled growl, like she wanted to talk but couldn&#8217;t quite.</p>
<p>He had his old Bladewarden&#8217;s sheath at his belt, loosely attached, <em>tachi</em> style blade nestled securely within.  It allowed him to move it around, so he could adjust the angle.  He moved it so the sheath was almost horizontal, the end pointed toward his belt buckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach,&#8221; he said.  With a flick of his thumb, he brought the blade about a quarter-inch out of the sheath.  His Sight let him see the placement it would have.</p>
<p>A blade, about ten feet long and three feet wide sprung out of the dirt, blade pointed down.  Ellingson, lurching into a forward attack, tripped over it, falling hard into the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>It looked like he could knock her down a few more times and she wouldn&#8217;t have the strength to get up after.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cost of this particular weapon.  It&#8217;s powerful, but it&#8217;s meant to encourage being a good Warden.  I buy each use of it with one of its pledges.  For that one, hmmm, six hours of tutoring someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck are you going to teach anyone?&#8221; she asked, her voice hoarse.  &#8220;Misery?  America&#8217;s following you and it&#8217;s like&#8230; the light&#8217;s going out in her soul.  Her love for her sister is being poisoned by your <em>shit.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>It took the entirety of the time of his response and her retort for her to get up off the ground.</p>
<p>In the distance, Cyn&#8217;s power flared.  Something went up in flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to count some coup or reduce my ability to call on this power, don&#8217;t bother.  This brand of practice gets pretty rigid, very &#8216;rule of law&#8217;.  It only cares about me following through.  So long as I teach something in the right department-&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Fuck off!&#8221;</em> she shouted, and her hoarse voice cracked from the strain of shouting with a bruised throat.  &#8220;Answer me!  What are you leaving them with!?  What are you giving them, except heartbreak!?  Except damage!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking them to do anything I didn&#8217;t do myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not you!&#8221; she shouted again, voice reedy, breaking again.  She clenched a fist.  It looked like she tried to clench the other, but it looked too weak to fully close.  &#8220;They&#8217;re not you!  Get your head out of your ass!  Teach!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay now,&#8221; he said.  He reoriented the blade, flicked the edge blade again, moving it out of the sheath another fraction.  He didn&#8217;t need much.  &#8220;<em>Secure.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>A blade sprung up to her left.  She startled, stumbling-</p>
<p>&#8220;And <em>cleanse</em>.&#8221;  Another flick.</p>
<p>Another blade to her right, which she crashed into the flat of.  It was thick enough it didn&#8217;t even wobble.</p>
<p>Boxing her in.  She found her balance, straightening, looking bewildered-</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty seems like she&#8217;d be a really good teacher.  She&#8217;s good with kids.  And goblins,&#8221; Ellingson said, quiet.  &#8220;Did you know that?  Do you even know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;d be very good at a lot of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get it.  She has passions, she has natural talents, and you&#8217;re not seeing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s free to be whatever she wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does she have to choose between having you and being- being soulless, like America is becoming, or not having you?  Is your head that firmly up your ass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hers.  Tell me so I can pass it on to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made deals with family.  To have things, money, options.  To help those girls become <em>great</em>.  To make sure nothing, not war, not death, not nature, not time, not fate, not blood, <em>nothing</em> will stand in their way.  I couldn&#8217;t forgive myself if I didn&#8217;t open every possible door.  But they have to walk through.  They have to learn more things, take certain steps.  Today wasn&#8217;t anything abrupt.  I&#8217;ve told Liberty.  I&#8217;ve urged, I&#8217;ve made it clear what the family&#8217;s expectations are,&#8221; he said, his voice soft.  He repeated, &#8220;But they have to walk through those open doors to take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or you emotionally destroy them?  Am I supposed to think that&#8217;s noble, you <em>fuck</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  That&#8217;s the cost.  If they don&#8217;t walk through, I&#8217;ll still be here.  Holding those doors open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it from someone who&#8217;s pretty much been there.  I think they&#8217;d rather you were with them instead of holding the door like some asshole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhhh.  I was wondering why you were fighting so hard for them.  It&#8217;s personal.  That&#8217;s a little disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not hearing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyn&#8217;s practice was like fireworks in the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done listening.  You&#8217;ve trained hard.  Your effort gets you a brief conversation.  Train for twice as long, we&#8217;ll have a conversation that&#8217;s double the length in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch the tip.  <em>Build.&#8221;</em>  He adjusted the sheath so the handle pointed down and the sheath pointed up, bringing the blade out a little more.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The blade sprung up out of the sidewalk right in front of her, forcing her back-</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthem!&#8221; she roared.</p>
<p>He turned it the right way around.  &#8220;And <em>Vigil.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The last blade made up for the one behind her.  It was only a few feet high, big enough to step on and over- but a blade that jabbed down from an opening in the air to plunge down secured it.  Four giant blades forming a square around her, with her in the center.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Miss, Miss, Miss,&#8221;</em> she said, from within her confinement, voice muffled.</p>
<p>He felt her go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirits, mark this moment, Ellingson has withdrawn from the field of battle.  Let her practices against me hold less sway, into and through our next encounters.  I count my coup by way of victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air shifted.</p>
<p>He looked over at Scott, who was leaning against the damaged hood of the car, arms folded, cigarette between his lips.  The cigarette smoke thinned out to become strands, which had spiders at the upper ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for the delay,&#8221; Anthem told him.</p>
<p>Scott grunted, shrugging.  &#8220;Kids, hm?  Would it bother you if I said I liked her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In another situation, if we weren&#8217;t at odds, I wouldn&#8217;t mind her being friends with Liberty.  Sorry that my dirty laundry landed in your lap, even briefly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevermind that.  Should we go?  I was already worrying my son was throwing a party while I was away, but with the way things are going, monsters attacking, you know, if it&#8217;s just a house trashed in a party, I&#8217;ll be glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  A moment.&#8221;  Anthem clicked the blade back into place.  The blades all disappeared into the earth, leaving cracks where they&#8217;d emerged.</p>
<p>He noted the design on the sheath, with little inset crystals that glowed with inner light, marking the pledges he&#8217;d made.  Some he&#8217;d handle on his own, and soon, but others- he reached into his jacket and pulled out a horn, and tipped the invisible contents onto some of the crystals.  They went dark again.</p>
<p>It was a good tool for killing or containing very large things, and anything to do with War.  He was reluctant to use some of the pledges.  He wasn&#8217;t very good at art, for one thing, and it was awkward to follow through on fidelity to a lord.  If he used them, the cost in power to clear them away was consequently higher.</p>
<p>Two remained lit.  Teaching and Cleansing.  A few hours of tutoring, and ridding an area of a dangerous taint.  Projects for next weekend, he supposed.  The latter was something he was bound to do, with the Carmine&#8217;s attack on Ontario.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn!&#8221; he hollered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep!&#8221; was the answering call.</p>
<p>She started making her way back to him, making a fighting retreat.</p>
<p>He checked the wards on the car, then reached into a jacket pocket for a booklet.  He paged through.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s secure our trip.  A convoy would be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohh?&#8221; Scott asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A minute spent organizing something now could spare us another delay if we&#8217;re attacked.  It&#8217;s a dark wilderness of the old style out there now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not complaining.  Let me know what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem used chalk to draw a sword symbol on the hood of the car, then took a needle and scraped it through the back of his hand, drawing the same.  He surrounded each with brief cuneiform scratches at eight points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think she&#8217;s going to look for a rematch?&#8221; Scott asked.</p>
<p>Anthem snorted.  &#8220;With how upset she was?  Yes, I think so.  Couldn&#8217;t tell you if it&#8217;s going to be in five minutes or five years, but she won&#8217;t leave this alone.  She said as much.  It&#8217;s personal.  A stand-in for another fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of stand-ins&#8230;&#8221;  He lapsed into Akkadian.  <em>Joy of Battle.</em></p>
<p>Foreign and strange echoes approached from various angles, as a vague shadow formed.  Each crashed into the shadow like waves on rock, leaving behind traces and fragments, while the rest was absorbed inward.</p>
<p>After about twenty, the shadow&#8217;s edges had solidified into something hard, and the individual fragments and lines filled it in.</p>
<p>A version of Anthem, eyes wide and wild, a dark smile on his face.  A simulacrum, representing one facet of himself, the part that enjoyed the fight, the thrill of it.  That could smile even while blood was being shed, whether it was his own or someone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>And a matching car, revving slightly.</p>
<p><em>Standing Watch.</em></p>
<p>Another version of himself.  Serious, eyes tracking the horizon.  Another car, engine off.</p>
<p><em>Towering Rage.</em></p>
<p>A mad attack dog.  Himself, pushed to the edge.  Angry, holding nothing back.</p>
<p><em>Bad Blood</em>.</p>
<p>Enmity, hatred, resentment, disgust.  A version of himself that didn&#8217;t want to be here.  It was almost sleepy, distracted, but given provocation and a proper enemy, the Bad Blood shadow-echo would wake up.</p>
<p>It felt like he was moving through a range of echoes of himself that called on the recent fight.  The reactions Ellingson had had to him.</p>
<p>But moving on to others didn&#8217;t help.  He hated the next one.</p>
<p><em>Driven Despair</em>.  It was the closest translation he&#8217;d come up with to it.</p>
<p>Quieter, contemplative, a planner.  Unlike Bad Blood, this one wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;wake up&#8217;.  It was slow to react, passive.  It rarely had a plan he hadn&#8217;t come up with himself, but a second brain helped, and it was especially good at recalling details he&#8217;d missed.</p>
<p>But it was a version of Anthem that kept its eyes down, lost in thought and grief of lost friends and family, and he was glad of that fact.  He didn&#8217;t like the rare occasions it made eye contact with him.</p>
<p><em>Shock and Awe</em>.</p>
<p>And he was back in safer territory.  A version of himself that was quick, surprising, intimidating, but just as easily caught off guard.</p>
<p><em>Crippling Fear</em>.  Mean, in a very different way from Towering Rage.  Intimidating.  It liked mind games, hurting and beating someone by crushing will rather than shedding blood.</p>
<p>And finally, to tie them together, <em>Brother in Arms</em>.  Trust, alliance, teamwork.</p>
<p>Each had its own car, each car in a different state.</p>
<p>Cyn had slowed as she approached, Mark Cavendar right behind her, hand at his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot.  I can heal him, but let&#8217;s do it in the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Dog Tag circling around.  I shot him,&#8221; Mark said.  &#8220;It&#8217;ll come back.  And where there&#8217;s one, there are probably others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good man,&#8221; Anthem said.  He motioned toward the car.</p>
<p>Cyn took the long way around, lifting up the hood momentarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know cars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I work cars when I&#8217;m not doing practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  We&#8217;re okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Headlight&#8217;s out.  Besides that, it wasn&#8217;t too hard a knock.  You&#8217;ll want to go in for body repair,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we fake something?&#8221; Scott asked.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that if we get pulled over, we&#8217;ll also get ambushed.  It feels like the way the spirits flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; Cyn said.  &#8220;The heat from the fire melted the insulation.  I don&#8217;t suppose you have a spare, and some of the wires?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Anthem answered.  &#8220;I have nearly everything.  I stay supplied.  It&#8217;s in the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were just opening the hatch at the back of the car when he heard it.  A high howl combined with a scream, echoing across Kennet below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems five minutes was closer to the mark than five years,&#8221; Scott commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems she&#8217;s really pissed,&#8221; Mark Cavendar threw in.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her?&#8221; Anthem asked.  &#8220;Ellingson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sound carried by spirits.  And implement,&#8221; Scott replied, nodding.</p>
<p>A streak of fire cut across the night sky.</p>
<p>It detonated like a firework.  Not that far off from directly overhead of them.</p>
<p>Anthem-Standing-Watch whistled lightly, jerking his head.</p>
<p>Anthem turned his head, looking&#8230; and saw the Dog Tag.</p>
<p>He drew a card for one gun, abyss tainted, and fired.</p>
<p>That would keep them down for longer.</p>
<p>Anthem-Standing-Watch whistled again, but he was able to draw a handgun from his hip, because Anthem kept one on his person often enough it was part of his template, which the simulacrums borrowed.  He shot a second Dog Tag, the gunshot echoing through the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe skip the headlight,&#8221; Cyn murmured.</p>
<p>There were three heavy bags of supplies.  One for weather emergencies, one for car repair, and one for obscure practice things and camping.  There was a surprising overlap in the last two, so they went in one bag.  He lifted one out, passing it to Cyn, then slammed the hatch.</p>
<p>Anthem-Standing-Watch whistled, a more nuanced sound, drawn out.</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s-Joy-of-Battle, smiling, began to chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;She stirred up the Undercity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling in all the chips,&#8221; Anthem said.  He climbed into the car.  The others followed suit, his other selves getting into their roughly identical vehicles, some in different shades of wear and tear or loving attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t smoke in the car,&#8221; he told Scott, as he belted in and turned over the engine, hoping there wasn&#8217;t damage Cyn had missed that would keep the car from starting.  It seemed fine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the smoke or the spiders that are bothering you?&#8221; Scott asked, in a bemused tone.  &#8220;I can solve one by opening a window, and solve another by not using practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that either bother me, it&#8217;s that I love my vehicles, I care for them, and I respect them.  Don&#8217;t smoke in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott flicked the cigarette out the window, leaning out to exhale.</p>
<p>No major issues, except a nasty grating as he reversed a few feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthem!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Anthem&#8217;s-Driven-Despair.  Anthem motioned and Scott Martin leaned out of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have an augur.  The undercity one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True.  Birds.  Watch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem-Standing-Watch turned.</p>
<p>Anthem reached into his coat for cards, pulled one out and whipped it at his counterpart.  The man glanced momentarily at it, then shook it out, until it became a leather thong and a small bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what that does?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other Anthem nodded, his eyes tracking the skyline.</p>
<p>There were people moving through Downtown, leaving buildings.  Moving in groups.  A few jogged forward, moving in a jerky way, as if they were competing with one another to be the ones in the lead, but not wanting to be <em>too</em> in the lead, because they&#8217;d be the first ones attacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid&#8217;s got an army at her disposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite <em>hers</em>, but you&#8217;re not entirely wrong either,&#8221; Anthem said.  He shifted gears and pulled out.</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s-Joy-of-Battle peeled out, swerving, and the crowd hurried out of the way as he drove straight at them, his laughter barely audible.  Anthem&#8217;s Towering Rage had an assault rifle and used it, firing in controlled bursts.</p>
<p>Always one in the back, under the seat.  It fit the car&#8217;s template, same as Anthem having a gun at his hip, blade at hip and ankle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not real,&#8221; Mark said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Anthem asked.</p>
<p>He caught only a couple of seconds of the action.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re glamour, I think.  Or very glamour-like illusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glamour,&#8221; Scott Martin murmured.</p>
<p>They were.  As the rifle&#8217;s shots cut through their lines, they crumbled into dust, rather than crumpling over as bullet-riddled bodies.  And behind them were others- ones without clear faces, fine if they were at the back of the group, but obvious now that the ones in front had fallen.  They existed as connective tissue, and without the ones in front, many of them fell apart as well, or they stumbled forward, blind.</p>
<p>Anthem-Standing-Watch honked, and swerved.  Anthem followed his cue.</p>
<p>Something crashed down onto the lane of the road to Anthem&#8217;s left.  Some construction that had been on top of one of the undercity&#8217;s buildings.</p>
<p>Another honk.  Too late for one of the other cars.  There was a bang, and tires squealed.</p>
<p>Anthem swerved, avoiding that tract of road, pulling into the lot of the graffiti-ridden gas station with, of all things, a pair of pink panties worked so the hose stuck through the leg holes.  There were people there too, older teens and twenty-something boys and girls springing to their feet, sprinting over, hoping Anthem would slow.</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s-Shock-and-Awe led the way, followed by Bad Blood and Crippling Fear.</p>
<p>Something was thrown from a window.  Big.  Anthem honked, a quarter-second behind Anthem-Standing-Watch&#8217;s warning honk.</p>
<p>It crashed into Bad Blood&#8217;s windshield, caving it in.  A teenage boy wearing a hockey helmet and pads and nothing else.  The vehicle skidded to a stop.</p>
<p>The ward on Anthem&#8217;s car went off, and the scratched-in marker for that ward on the car&#8217;s dash glowed, telling him it was the roof.  Something else had been thrown at their car.  He spotted it in the rear-view mirror.  It might have been a bag of shit.  A full, black, garbage-on-the-curb bag.</p>
<p>They knew which car was his, now, if they couldn&#8217;t tell by Sight.</p>
<p>The tunnel that went under the highway and out of this place was in view, now, at least.</p>
<p>Standing atop the highway was a figure with purple eyes.  And across the way, people were still running across the road, leaving things behind- furniture, pallets, a toilet that was dropped partway across, where it shattered, parts littering the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are the wards on this car?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weaker than they were but sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyn opened her door and leaned out, gripping the inside handle of the car.  Anthem&#8217;s side-view mirror caught the glow as one of Cyn&#8217;s personal shrines came to life.</p>
<p>Black lightning began to fire out, targeting the thinnest parts of the way through.  Whatever it hit was obliterated- a half-couch turned into particles, half of the toilet turned into a smear of white grit, the other half sent spinning off the side of the road with enough force it hit the slight edge of the sidewalk and flipped through the air before falling into a ditch.</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s eyes scanned the area- was there a trap behind the barrier?  Runes on tunnel walls?</p>
<p>Hayward, the one with the cat mask, she was a trickster of a different brand.</p>
<p>He drove, trusting Cyn to tell him if she couldn&#8217;t clear the way, his eyes more on Hayward, above.</p>
<p>Was she dropping something over the railing, when he thought the coast was clear?</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirits are licking their metaphorical little lips,&#8221; Scott said, leaning forward to better look up.  &#8220;Something dramatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felt wrong.  &#8220;Inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyn swung her way inside, slamming the door after her.  He honked, and hit the brakes.</p>
<p>He stopped, nose roughly at the point where the barricade had been.</p>
<p>There was a dull flash, and then a rumble.  Anthem&#8217;s Sight painted lines from bridge to ground.</p>
<p>No.  She wasn&#8217;t dropping anything over the edge.</p>
<p>She dropped the bridge, collapsing the tunnel.  The rumble got intense enough to rattle the car, and everything went dark as the dust cloud rolled out, briefly obscuring even the headlights.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it they&#8217;re trying to kill us?&#8221; Mark asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car is warded.  We would&#8217;ve been alive, but trapped.  Now we&#8217;re&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still trapped?&#8221; Mark asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn?  Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s ways from the above to the below.  At least closer to the cabins.  We didn&#8217;t really explore the possibilities this far to the north of town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need ones a car can travel,&#8221; Anthem said.  He drew his gun, using his Sight as he swept the area.  He didn&#8217;t have much use for the investigative side of the Sight, so he&#8217;d tuned it into something complementary to various tools and practices.  Trajectories, lines of effect, areas that would be included in any blasts.  A laser sight or laser guidance for anything, whether it was a gun or a large scale explosive.  Incoming or outgoing.</p>
<p>Having a gun in hand helped focus that Sight.  As he swept through the smoke, he sensed something closer.  Something big.  He fired.</p>
<p>It <em>pinged.</em></p>
<p>The figure was a man, burly, wearing improvised equipment.  Duct tape and the sort of bulletproof plexiglass that was put up in high-crime areas, plus various bits of armor.  He charged forward, slamming the plexiglass against the windows on the one side of the car, leaning in, to block the doors from opening.  Bearded, grinning, the man shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;m unstoppable, motherfuckers!&#8221;</p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t all glamour.</p>
<p>Other denizens followed, ducking through the dust-thick air.  A pair of people with some kind of cobbled-together boot for the car tire, with spikes pointing inward, and two bike locks.  They slammed it into place.</p>
<p>Anthem drew the other one of the two guns he&#8217;d considered using on Ellingson earlier.  He&#8217;d used the one that went for quantity.  There was another meant for penetrating barriers.  Practice and&#8230;</p>
<p>He shot.</p>
<p>The &#8216;unstoppable&#8217; man went down.  Others backed off.  Practice and other kinds of barrier.</p>
<p>Anthem opened his car door, stepping outside, relying on the Sight and the movement of the gun as much as he used his eyes.  Neither was perfect, but the two together was enough.  He bent down and pulled the makeshift boot away.  They hadn&#8217;t had time to lock it.  Good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ellingson!&#8221; he called out.  &#8220;I thought you were a duelist!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthem.&#8221;  The voice carried through the smoke, coming from no direction in particular.  &#8220;That&#8217;s a label Alexander came up with, from an early initial read.  It&#8217;s not accurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re using your own temporary army, I&#8217;ll call in my own forces.  I don&#8217;t think you want me to do that.  It&#8217;s up to you.  One on one, or your group against mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyn released another blast of pure destruction, shooting through the smoke.</p>
<p>Scott was breathing in the dust in the air.  Slowly transforming it.  Deep breath in, deep breath out.  The cloud around him thinned out into strands with every exhalation, bowing away from him as he breathed out, bowing toward him as he breathed in, expanding out.  It resembled a woman&#8217;s hose developing runs.  The strands were webbing.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Anthem had been around any woman who wore hose.  His daughters weren&#8217;t the type.  Even ironically.</p>
<p>Which was fine.  He just wished-</p>
<p>He wished a lot of things.</p>
<p>There was a scream.  His own.  By the placement-</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s-Shock-and-Awe went down, and a figure at his back went down with him, clinging to his back and shoulders, blade in hand.  The red eyes of Ellingson&#8217;s fox mask glowed through the dust in the air.</p>
<p>He pulled a card out.  Thread Cutter.  A knife.</p>
<p>He shook it into existence and threw it hard at the fallen simulacrum&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>It ricocheted off, chasing the connection to the girl who had stabbed him.</p>
<p>He heard the other ricochet- one that shouldn&#8217;t have happened.  He put a knife out.  He had enough claim to the blade, and he&#8217;d counted a significant victory against her earlier.</p>
<p>It found his hand, slapping against his palm.</p>
<p>He sorted through some spell cards.  Temporary enchantments he could lay on the blade, his eyes scanning the surroundings.</p>
<p>Other Anthems found him.  Anthem-the-Brother-in-Arms went to Shock and Awe, bending down to see if there was any needed medical care.  Bad Blood was an inverse of Brother in Arms, someone who would go hard against the enemy given provocation, instead of supporting the team.  He was laying down suppressive fire, keeping the worst of the group of undercity denizens at bay.</p>
<p>Towering Rage was out.  Crippling Fear stalked the shadows, a short distance away.  Standing Watch was there, off to the fringes, keeping an eye out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the plan?&#8221; Scott asked.  &#8220;Get in the car, see if we can get through?&#8221;</p>
<p>The legs of an eighteen foot tall spider spirit moved through the cloud of dust behind Scott, picking its way past the sticky strands that surrounded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or do you think you can duel her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to duel her.  I don&#8217;t think she thinks she can win, so she&#8217;s taking the cowardly approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you calling <em>me</em> a coward?&#8221; Ellingson&#8217;s voice echoed.</p>
<p>Red eyes opened in the gloom.</p>
<p>Mark moved his hands, creating a spear that darted out to that spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bait, Cavendar.  She wouldn&#8217;t show herself if she wasn&#8217;t sure she could,&#8221; Anthem told the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck.  I thought there&#8217;d be a break from all the shit when you offered me a ride out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not all that much better if you get past the town limits,&#8221; Anthem murmured.</p>
<p>A practice activated about twenty feet away.  Another of those elementary spell cards.  It created a flash of light.</p>
<p>Scott Martin&#8217;s area that he&#8217;d turned into spiderwebs acted as if it was a different realm entirely.  The flash of light ended up being more like lightning that lit up clouds in an overcast sky, but didn&#8217;t touch ground.  Didn&#8217;t reach them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the fox.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dust was clearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost Joy, Despair, Rage, and Shock,&#8221; Anthem-the-Brother-in-Arms noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;  <em>That leaves Brotherhood, Watch, Fear, and Bad Blood.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn,&#8221; Anthem said.  &#8220;You take ambient spiritual energy and condense it.  Channel it into force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can and do, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott, would you mind if she borrowed what you&#8217;ve got to spare?  It would help to have a path we can safely travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged glances.</p>
<p>Cyn created an orb above her head.  It was swaddled in gossamer, dark masses moving within.</p>
<p>It shuddered, bulged, and then burst, releasing a geyser of sticky strands, dark and dangerous spiders, and wisps of finer gossamer.</p>
<p>They got into the car.  Anthem-Standing-Watch got into his, apparently content to lead the way and scout for danger.  He had a dead bird in his hands.</p>
<p><em>The Cat&#8217;s Eye Sling is good at penetrating augury.  Every augury has a tell, and if you catch the right one, you can punch right through to catch the person on the other side.</em></p>
<p>She&#8217;d be blind on one eye, maybe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Scott said, as they peeled out, following after Anthem-Standing-Watch.  The coast was clear enough- people couldn&#8217;t get past the strands, and practice couldn&#8217;t easily get past the overwhelming spiritual dominance that Cyn and Scott brought into things.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cryptic.  We&#8217;re in the middle of a situation, one we can readily handle, but if it costs us too much in the way of resources, that makes our efforts outside this town harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many sanctuaries are there?&#8221; Cyn asked.  &#8220;Rest spots, safe zones.  Areas outside of the Carmine&#8217;s influence, still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Churches, some nodes of civilization.  Some lordships that weren&#8217;t Musser&#8217;s, that aren&#8217;t rabidly anti-Musser either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it worth it, Anthem?&#8221; Scott asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go pulling that, alright?  Not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fox-shaped shadow darted across the road ahead of Standing Watch.  The car swerved, honking to warn the cars that followed.</p>
<p>And in the loudness of it, maybe helped by the fact he&#8217;d counted coup against her, it distorted glamour.</p>
<p>Lucy Ellingson, standing amid the strands, wearing the fox mask, camouflaged to resemble the strands and spiders.</p>
<p>And the shadow distorted, revealing a tangle of wood and barbed wire.  It had unspooled-</p>
<p>The tires of Crippling Fear&#8217;s dust-coated, grimy car popped.  It skidded, blocking the road.</p>
<p>Anthem managed to stop in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Running low on that destructive energy,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;Are we even making progress?  it&#8217;s a fight to make it a single block.  And we&#8217;re turning, taking detours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy does it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He climbed out of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you hope to accomplish?&#8221; he called out.  He still had the gun at his side.  &#8220;Ruin my car?  Slow me down?  Get me angry enough I lash out?  I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d survive the lashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor choice of words,&#8221; Ellingson said, voice echoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ll whittle me down?  Break me?  I don&#8217;t think you understand the weight of everything in consideration, Ellingson.  I don&#8217;t think you understand that if you offer me something, it has to outweigh homes, treasures, luxuries, tools, weapons, and opportunities priced in the millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money.  That&#8217;s where you start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You live in a poor town.  And I know what happens when you can&#8217;t afford to have options.  I figured it was a good angle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fourteen, Anthem.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had more than a couple hundred bucks in my bank account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Another angle.  If you want me to take your side, you have to make an offer that outweighs the safety, security, power, and potential of what Musser is bringing to the table.  The history- personal history, favors he&#8217;s done me and I him.  The history in the broader sense.  And the future.  For my girls.  For all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Musser&#8217;s future?  That&#8217;s a threat, not a promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we make it past all this without the kind of strength and coalition he can bring to bear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t even keep your own family together, Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I well and truly believe they&#8217;ll come around.  It might take some exposure to the real world.  A bit of exploration, to find their own strength, forge their own paths.  And to figure out what they need.  It was what it was like for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what sucks?&#8221;  Ellingson&#8217;s voice came from another direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I could run down a list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know your daughters all that well.  Avery&#8217;s been way more in touch with Liberty, and she&#8217;s fought America some.  But I think I might know them better than you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hell of an arrogant thing to say to a father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I count coup for that?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only if you say it definitively.  No &#8216;I thinks&#8217;.  To really matter, it needs to be open to challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At which point we end up in a duel of words, listing off details, asking challenging questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem smiled.</p>
<p>Anthem-delivering-Crippling-Fear was moving through the strands, hunting.  Anthem-Standing-Watch whirled the sling in one hand, eyes tracking.</p>
<p>Bad Blood had calmed down, after the initial spark of bitterness and hate against the group that had damaged his car.  Settling into a more dormant role.  Brotherhood lingered close to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spiders and spiderwebs, huh?&#8221; Ellingson asked.  &#8220;Why, Mr. Martin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like spiders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you done?&#8221; Anthem called out.  &#8220;Are you going to waste our time, talking from the shadows, refusing to come out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking for a witty way to segue into my next move,&#8221; Ellingson replied, voice coming from multiple directions at once.  &#8220;This is all spirit, right?  You know what else is spirit, technically?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Anthem said.  He looked at the others who&#8217;d gotten out of the vehicle.  Cyn and Scott Martin were on guard, searching the area.  He lowered his voice.  &#8220;In the car or stay close to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached into his coat-</p>
<p>And they attacked.  Dog Tags.  Technically Animus by label, though it got complicated.  They were spirit, and that might&#8217;ve made the spider webs easier to venture into than it was for others.</p>
<p>It was still <em>Scott&#8217;s</em> spider webs, still the domain of a powerful shaman-</p>
<p>But they only had to get so far.  The guns weren&#8217;t spirit.</p>
<p>Anthem leaned back hard, back to the car door, head turned.</p>
<p>The wards on the car lit up, lifting away from the surfaces, catching the incoming bullets.</p>
<p>And in the midst of the sound, audible only because Anthem had done rituals to protect his hearing from loud noises when he was new to war magic, he heard a blade trail on the road, scraping, making an inconsistent sound, as it bounced over raised bits and dipped into depressions.</p>
<p>Carving out a circle.</p>
<p>Ellingson stood within, hand up.  A duelist&#8217;s mark on the palm of her right hand, which was the same one she&#8217;d had trouble making a fist with earlier.</p>
<p>The simulacrums had fallen.  Their cars didn&#8217;t have the same wards.  They didn&#8217;t have the same protections and practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to fight her?&#8221; Mark Cavendar asked.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know you well enough to know how you&#8217;d handle her.</em><em>  I haven&#8217;t seen you fight</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;No tricks, no traps?&#8221; Anthem asked.  &#8220;I won&#8217;t get shot while walking over to the arena?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, me, this arena.  No outside interference, the Dog Tags will stand down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice echoed as it had before.</p>
<p>Anthem approached, moving away from the car and its wards, past the disintegrating simulacrums.  He picked up the sling he&#8217;d given Standing Watch, and the bag of cat&#8217;s eye shot.  He put them away.</p>
<p>He stopped at the boundary of the duelist&#8217;s circle.  &#8220;We put any grudges to rest here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I win, you let us go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand in your way.  Won&#8217;t speak for the others-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, your dog tags, Hayward, Kelly, any allies you&#8217;ve brought in.  Any Others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t control them, Anthem.  The Dog Tags aren&#8217;t mine.  The Others aren&#8217;t under my control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say you&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog Tags!&#8221; Ellingson called out.  &#8220;If I have any particular sway with you&#8230; back off if they win.  Let them go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goblins too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goblins!&#8221; she called out.  Her voice carried, a rune at her chest glowing as it transmitted the sound.  &#8220;If any of you hear me, I&#8217;m telling you to back off.  Stand down, this is me and Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>She looked ragged.  Tired.  Beaten up.</p>
<p>America and then Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays, then him.</p>
<p>He had the Bladewarden&#8217;s knife, he had an entire arsenal on his person.  He had combat practices, enchantments.  He had offensive enhancements.</p>
<p>He stepped across the boundary of the circle.  It was thirty feet across.  A fair size.  Flat, with no cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;What changed?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changed?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between you running away last time, and you picking this fight.  Indulge me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing changes,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the problem, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew a knife.</p>
<p>He eyed her carefully.</p>
<p>She lunged.</p>
<p>Moving faster than she should.  Further than she should.</p>
<p>He crossed blades with her, and she was heavier than she should be.  He pushed her away with a grunt.</p>
<p>Yeah.  So they were doing <em>this</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You call on forces that exist outside here.  Oaths and deals,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I guess so.  Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll invoke my right to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved his own knife to the other hand, then pressed his palm against the back of his hand, where he&#8217;d inscribed the markings and arrangement for calling out the eight facets of himself.</p>
<p>Shock first.  The element of surprise.  The traces of the simulacrum flowed through and into the arena, allowed through by spirits and the other forces that oversaw the duel.  A burst of speed, a burst of impulse, to match what she&#8217;d just done to him.</p>
<p>She parried, moved away- escaped a grasping hand.</p>
<p>Terror, then.  While he was close.  The echo met him, and in the moment it crashed into him, a wave on rocks, he was intimidation personified, capable of cruelty.  She didn&#8217;t even flinch.  His knife didn&#8217;t meet flesh, to be able to twist, or do something terrible.</p>
<p>Then Rage, to press the attack.  To be strong, towering, bigger, more forceful.</p>
<p>More reckless.</p>
<p>She cut him.</p>
<p>And he turned that toward Bad Blood.  Resentment, hate.  Indignation.</p>
<p>He got the cut this time.  Impaling a shoulder.</p>
<p>Breaking glamour.</p>
<p>Anthem absorbed Joy next, chuckling at first, then laughing.  It was a kind of coup, that made the arena more his.  To be so comfortable in it.</p>
<p>The Winter Faerie wore Lucy Ellingson&#8217;s skin again.  As the skin was shed, it frosted the arena- walls and ground both.  Anthem swiped his blade through the air, exhaling slowly.</p>
<p>He had just enough clout to keep that frost from touching him.  It cleared away from the ground, too.</p>
<p>He was entirely unsurprised at the trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grayson Hennigar beat you recently.  I&#8217;m stronger than him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A different kind of strength,&#8221; the Fae answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no special clout with the Dogs of War, a goblin certainly wouldn&#8217;t listen to you.  Is that the plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved in, striking out- and was parried.  An entirely different fight when the Fae was larger than him, graceful but strong.  The size difference resembled how Ellingson had fought Anthem.  Except Anthem was the small one now.</p>
<p>He drew in Standing Watch.  To analyze, study, watch for detail, and to be ready for any tricks.</p>
<p>There were no tricks, but there were details too.  Injuries recent and old.</p>
<p>Anthem then took on Driven Despair.  Contemplative grief, pensive sadness.  It was deep thought, often dark.</p>
<p>To digest that which he&#8217;d seen.</p>
<p>More than anything, he&#8217;d come out of grief before, with drive.  It was why this facet took this shape.  He didn&#8217;t like it, but he knew its power.  Drive that had carried him from a bare acquaintanceship with A.J. Musser to a position of standing.  That had helped him earn his place back in his family.  Earn his girls&#8217; place back in the family.  With access to their resources.  With access to Musser&#8217;s.  To more.</p>
<p>He took the temporary enchantments out of his jacket.  Each inscribed on a paper, papers all placed together, with a clip to secure them.  There were tabs at the side, and each was marked with a symbol that let him identify them in a moment, their backs heavily decorated.</p>
<p>The Fae let him.</p>
<p>Anthem tossed them into the air.  The Fae moved, ducking lower than a giant should seem able to do.  Anthem leaped over the knife&#8217;s slash.</p>
<p>Old rituals helped that movement too.  A bit more strength and power in the course of duels.</p>
<p>Anthem speared two cards with the knife as he twisted in the air.  The Fae&#8217;s one hand was occupied by the duelist&#8217;s mark.  That wasn&#8217;t a lie or trick.  He had been Summer Fae, and one that liked duels.  But the mark was held in the hand and it forced the one asking for the duel to fight one-handed.</p>
<p>And the Fae was still injured after fighting Grayson Hennigar.  There was a chest wound from another not-too distant encounter.</p>
<p>Anthem threw the blade, cards still spiked on it, and the Fae parried it.</p>
<p>The blade and its two cards had stopped in the air.  That was one card.  It remained there, poised, waiting to strike as if it had a will of its own.</p>
<p>The other card turned it to cold iron.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cards have backs to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed,&#8221; the Fae replied, as it faced Anthem down.  Anthem now without a knife.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Centurion,&#8221;</em> Anthem whispered.</p>
<p>The Fae turned, swatting the blade out of the air as it speared in.  An awkward strike, owing to those injuries.  The blade was hit hard enough that it cut through the cards.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Every single card in the arena, scattered, had been turned into a duplicate.</p>
<p>A cold iron blade suspended in air, willing to strike.</p>
<p>With the other cards he&#8217;d used earlier, on the drive in and in dealing with Ellingson and the denizens of the undercity, he had seventy-two.</p>
<p>Four would be enough for a sufficient binding.</p>
<p>The Fae didn&#8217;t move to strike.  It knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fight things like you for a living, Fae.  Monsters and warriors, anything too difficult for others to take down in combat.  Goblin or Fae, even the rare, small primeval.  Wraith kings, lesser gods, Lords.  Did you think you&#8217;d win?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it from an old soul, Anthem Tedd,&#8221; the Faerie said.  &#8220;You&#8217;re victorious, but you&#8217;re not winning, and that is a terrible road to walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like sour grapes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The grapes are fine, Anthem,&#8221; the Fae replied.  &#8220;I&#8217;m injured, badly enough I won&#8217;t easily hide it.  But I got you to expend a lot of your crucial boons and tricks.  She&#8217;ll have her second try at you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to be put out of your misery now, or do you want to be bound and made to see how little that actually matters?&#8221; Anthem asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want, to not bind him?&#8221; Ellingson asked.</p>
<p>Anthem remained very still.  Seventy-two cold iron blades hovered at different points around the arena.  Some were close enough to the Fae to graze him with every intake of breath.  Others were at the edges, or above.  &#8220;What are you offering?  I&#8217;d like to be free to go without inteference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A duel.  You and me.  Same promises you made with Guilherme.  Except those things count for more when they come out of my mouth, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They should.  But that leads me to ask.  What changed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a healing potion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s taking you back to your starting position, isn&#8217;t it?  Which wasn&#8217;t all that great, was it?  Even at the top of your game&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not my starting position.  It&#8217;s kind of an amateur healing potion, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Partial recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I see it, I could achieve something much more effective by binding the Winter Faerie and turning him against your town.  That should get me and my allies a pretty clear road out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Winter Fae are hard to bind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m capable, believe me, and he&#8217;s young for Winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be called young again.  What a thought,&#8221; the Fae replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need more, Ellingson,&#8221; Anthem announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dogs of War,&#8221; Ellingson caled out.  Her shadow moved beyond the bounds of the Arena.  &#8220;I know this is shitty to do, but I&#8217;m wearing the necklace with John Stiles and the Songbird on it.  You guys say that counts for something&#8230; let him go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My allies too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave them be?&#8221; Ellingson asked.  &#8220;Go&#8230; keep the peace with whatever practitioners got agitated, in the bigger group.  When gunshots were going off.  Don&#8217;t shoot, don&#8217;t kill, don&#8217;t maim.  Let&#8217;s- I hope this works out okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fae?  Seven days and seven nights, stand down.  You need to heal anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; the Fae replied.  &#8220;I will stand down.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a Winter Fae, that was as good as an oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tag me in?&#8221; Ellingson asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unconventional, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fae pressed a hand to the barrier.  So did Ellingson.</p>
<p>As he left, she entered.</p>
<p>She had recuperated, but she looked rough still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Centurion, stand down,&#8221; Anthem said.</p>
<p>The rules of the arena and of duels woudln&#8217;t allow for too primed a field to start.  This many pre-prepared blades would be a problem.  It would count against him karmically.</p>
<p>He let the cards fly to his hand.  Most were badly damaged or spent.</p>
<p>The moment the last card made contact, he moved.  So did Ellingson.  She drew a sword.  He held a knife.</p>
<p>A tentative exchange of blows.  Blade met blade, a ward glowed, pushing him away, but he was strong enough to push through.  Especially with the earlier coup.</p>
<p>She slammed hard into the wall of the barrier.  Flecks of frost fell down around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you trained?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Decades,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many draughts of healing do you have left?  Alchemists rarely make the one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that for me to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, I&#8217;ll give you opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, then.  I had three.&#8221;</p>
<p>He still held cards.  He picked one out, touching it to his knife- and Ellingson lashed out with a whip.  He closed in- and whip broke away, becoming string.  Her cape became a cowl with blades at the edges, and she turned- trying to cut him as it flared out mid-spin.</p>
<p>He avoided the worst of it and stabbed in- and she had a claw.</p>
<p>But he knew it made her weaker.  Pushing it like this.  It drew on her.</p>
<p>He pressed in, knife meeting claw- and she deftly disarmed him.</p>
<p>The enchantment on the knife brought it straight back to his hand.  He stabbed her shoulder with enough force behind him to shove her into the barrier again.  She sank to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221; she swore.  She reached for her belt and downed a potion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh gods and spirits, Verona, that tastes like sour butt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can be pretty bad,&#8221; Anthem agreed.</p>
<p>He waited, letting it work.  Mending the wound, and some other things that hadn&#8217;t fully mended the first time around.</p>
<p>She stood.  &#8220;I see America in you sometimes.  Liberty too.  Different bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to talk about my daughters, earn it.  Score a win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a part of you I see in Guilherme, too.  That likes drawing out something in me.  Making me try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like those who give up.  I respect those who don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you gave up both of them so easily, didn&#8217;t you?  You fucking coward,&#8221; Lucy said, the hoarseness reaching her voice again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she seemed to take that as some kind of advantage or win.  A moment to strike.  She acted.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d been willing to let her heal more, but- okay.</p>
<p>He fended off the attack from transforming weapons.  She had tells.  Ones the Fae had worked on with her, but that snuck through.  Leading with the elbow.  Breath.</p>
<p>He kicked her in the lower leg.  Forceful enough, a shin kick could make an ongoing fight impossible.  Everything flowed from the legs and stance.</p>
<p>While she stumbled back, he enchanted another knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one more draught?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say use it, but if you take that recommendation, you&#8217;ll find yourself wanting it later and you&#8217;ll feel like I cheated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use it,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Because this fucking hurts.  Ow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t argue at me again.  I respect the amount you&#8217;ve grown in mere months, but I can&#8217;t respect the line of argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does this end?&#8221; Ellingson asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s no big surprises, I win, I leave you alive, that&#8217;s a bargaining point, it&#8217;d be appreciated if you return the favor by making it easier for me to go.  Then, I dont know.  This seemed personal for you.  Maybe you reflect in the time it takes to mend.  However much of that is natural healing and however much is brewing time for your amateur alchemist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinda nice to know you&#8217;re not going to try to kill me.  My mom might, though.  Oh man.  Fuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it worth it?  Upsetting her?  Being hurt?  To take a pointless stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellingson shrugged.  &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll find out how upset she is, how hurt I end up, how pointless this is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d said I&#8217;d end this by killing you, what would you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asked for a forfeit.  Force-ended the duel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t stop me killing you if I had a mind to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buys me a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Miss-Miss-Miss a way out again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re healed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still a bit out of breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to think of a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so fucking mad at you,&#8221; she said, quiet.  &#8220;At all of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anger&#8217;s good fuel for moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a bizarre person,&#8221; she whispered.  Her expression looked concerned- not for herself, but just in general.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re both looking at a picture of a castle and you see nobility while I only see ruin.  I don&#8217;t see you moving forward, I see you going <em>backward</em>.  And the more I do, the more it feels like&#8230; I get why America&#8217;s so fucked up, and how Liberty&#8217;s heading that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t badmouth my daughters, Ellingson.  Or I might get <em>far</em> less merciful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You abandoned them!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was tired of this.  He moved.  She moved as well- a spell card, to create a splash of water at the center of the arena.</p>
<p>Water that froze with the ambient winter glamour.</p>
<p>She moved in that odd way she had when fighting Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays.  An enhancement whenever water came into play.</p>
<p>Faster, more focused.</p>
<p>Creating a spear.</p>
<p>He let it pierce him.  The first meaningful strike he&#8217;d suffered tonight.  He had other protections, security against these things, and he leaned on it now.  He&#8217;d assessed her, he knew the tricks.</p>
<p>She pierced his shoulder, and then tried to push back.  He held his ground, and touched an enchantment card to the spear&#8217;s shaft.  One meant for a thrown projectile, like a throwing knife or hatchet, or for a fistful of ammunition, to be quickly fired.</p>
<p>To turn the weapon hot.</p>
<p>It seared his flesh.  It seared her hands.  She dropped it, then hurried to pull off the ring she wore.</p>
<p>A good trophy to take from his victory.</p>
<p>She reached inside her cloak- he reached for a card that was damaged but serviceable.  Touching it to his lips.</p>
<p>Cold iron.</p>
<p>Threads of cold iron ran through his veins, imbuing him- giving him a special sort of security.  A bit of durability, and just what he needed to punch decisively through glamour.</p>
<p>She used a goblin trick instead.  A pellet that exploded into foul substance.</p>
<p>Her eyes glowed in the dark that resulted.  She could see and breathe.  He endured, watching for opportunity.  The iron that was exposed to the fog rusted and peeled away, gouging flesh.</p>
<p>This felt like spite.  A few final dirty moves as a parting gift.</p>
<p>But the danger was still there.  He felt out, Sight activated, his body temporarily the weapon, laced with iron, and his Sight gave him lines of attack, helping him feel an extra arm&#8217;s reach through the murk.</p>
<p>There were three of her.  One unmasked.  One with a fox mask.  One with a goat mask.</p>
<p>No trick shell game this time.  No room for nuance in this thick cloud of goblinness.  There was a real her.</p>
<p>He grabbed her, picked her up, and threw her down to the ground with the kind of strength that would have let him put a fist through an engine block.</p>
<p>The arena shattered.  The thick brown cloud dispersed, no longer contained in the arena.</p>
<p>She rolled onto her back, eyes glowing red in the dissipating fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move.  You&#8217;re hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>She coughed, then looked like she wished she hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a mind to take that ring of yours as my prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prize,&#8221; Ellingson said, groaning a bit.  &#8220;Oh, good for you, you won.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to tip the scales slightly toward you, in the interest of fairness, respect for the arena.  But there&#8217;s only so much I can do.  Decades against months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can win every fight, Anthem, and still lose out, you know that, right?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;Win an argument, lose a family.  Win this&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The goblin fog lifted.</p>
<p>He could see more eyes.  Yellow and red.  Every second, there were more of them visible through the fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goblins,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to tell you to back off, any clout I have&#8230; stop, don&#8217;t do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The response came as a croak from the periphery.  &#8220;And I&#8217;m obliged to tell you <em>fuck that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, Toadswallow,&#8221; Lucy said, as she lay there.  &#8220;Figured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Sir Toadswallow,&#8221; Anthem said.</p>
<p>There were a lot of goblins.  Glaring.  Occupying just about all of the ground and every flat surface from one end of the block of downtown to the other.</p>
<p>The hell?</p>
<p>&#8220;You did tell us to spread the word, Lucy dear.  That Anthem Tedd has been a royal dick and abandoned his daughters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you underestimate your daughters, Anthem,&#8221; Toadswallow said.  &#8220;They&#8217;re loved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you get it, Anthem?&#8221; Ellingson asked.  &#8220;Be careful how you answer.  These guys are pretty hair-trigger.  You&#8217;re alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow added,  &#8220;After the goblins showed up, we offered your buddies a safer way out.  They accepted.  Or two did.  The third one went with them.  Two of them, strong enough, one of you with a bunch of goblins pissed off at him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem turned.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t impossible to win.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d get hurt in the process.</p>
<p>Which made other things too difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is such a waste,&#8221; he told them.  &#8220;It&#8217;s all going to hell out there.  There are real monsters out there.  It&#8217;s like our nation&#8217;s at war and you insist on setting fire to our airfields and docks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The waste is you seem surprised by what your daughters are capable of leveraging, by their charisma, natural leadership, and their abilities in this field,&#8221; Toadswallow growled.</p>
<p>Anthem turned to face the goblin.</p>
<p>He saw Liberty there, in the background, by a pink haired goblin, her eyes downcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you.  I wanted you to be able to face anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.  We.  Me and my gang of badass ugly-cute goblins.&#8221;  The words were cheery, but the look on her face was sad.  &#8220;Wish you were along for the ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one thing you needed to say, Anthem,&#8221; Toadswallow said.  &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at Ellingson.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you try to take her hostage, I promise you, this ends poorly for you.  Liberty loves you but we&#8217;ll still rip you limb from limb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what happens?&#8221; Anthem asked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;Today,&#8221; the woman announced, &#8220;we have a few sheets, Everything Girl is going to be handing them out.  Please take one.  There, we have a number of scenarios listed.  Some big, some small.  I want you to get into groups of three, please, and sit yourselves down together, and brainstorm.  We&#8217;re going to think of healthy ways to handle the situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem ventured in from the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; the woman asked.  She had a dead and badly taxidermied cat wrapped around her head.  He held out the sheet.  &#8220;New student.  Anthem Tedd.  Welcome to civility classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>America, sitting off to one side, slumped in her seat, chuckled to herself, looking at him.  She wore goggles with holographic naked men superimposed on the lenses, which probably meant there was one at the center and front of her vision at all times.  She gave him a little wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find a group, join in, please.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;  He picked up a chair.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t like this.</p>
<p>The quiet.  The idea of- of sitting down.  Of being in one place for that long.  Of not picking up a weapon.</p>
<p>It had been a good thirteen years and three months since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I join you?&#8221; he asked his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to bring our grade down, Daddy?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;Are we graded?  We&#8217;re not graded.  But are you going to make us look bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmmmmm.  I&#8217;m thinking nah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be inclusive, America,&#8221; the teacher told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, <em>fine</em>, I guess.  I guesssss,&#8221; she drew it out.</p>
<p>He rubbed the top of her head, then sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you got condemned to this crap,&#8221; America told him.  <em>&#8220;You? </em> Now I don&#8217;t feel half as bad as I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure.  I bet, oh my god.  That&#8217;s amazing though.  Hilarious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Focus on the assignment, please,&#8221; the teacher told them.  &#8220;Or today won&#8217;t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the worksheet, looking it over.  A lesson from his old days at practitioner school, where he&#8217;d met Musser.  To read it over, assess the test.  See if there were patterns, or if later questions inherently answered earlier ones.</p>
<p>Situation thirteen.  The death of a loved one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,&#8221; America whispered, leaning in closer to him.</p>
<p>He looked.</p>
<p>Liberty, wearing a goblin mask, talking to the teacher.</p>
<p>Then Liberty walked over, picking up a chair on the way.</p>
<p>Joining them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You too?  They&#8217;re really going for the whole damn set, friendship be damned, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; Liberty said.  She propped a foot up on the edge of America&#8217;s seat, sitting back.  She sighed, and gave Anthem a look.  &#8220;Volunteering.  It&#8217;s an opportunity to hang out, huh?  As a family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing this shit on purpose,&#8221; America said.  &#8220;I think she might&#8217;ve gotten cursed.  Or sick.  Maybe lead poisoning.  From one of the things we shoved up her nose back when she was a kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have other things you want to do, I won&#8217;t be hurt,&#8221; he told Liberty.  &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a bit.  There&#8217;s a lot going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re underestimating how much I want to spend real time with you,&#8221; Liberty told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my god, gag me, urk, urk,&#8221; America said, finger in mouth.</p>
<p>Liberty swatted her elbow, forcing the finger all the way back.  America gagged, then threw up.  Then continued throwing up, drawing on goblin energies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have to clean that up,&#8221; Liberty pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fault,&#8221; America mumbled.</p>
<p>Anthem smiled.</p>
<p>The teacher was looking over, hands on hips.</p>
<p>America slurped up the entirety of the spillage, reversing the stream, then sat back, giving her best innocent smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do you have, Daddy-o?&#8221; America asked.  &#8220;Three weeks, here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The writs from my hunting of the founder still hold.  Six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months.  No kidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty days at a time.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes,&#8221; he told them.  &#8220;Musser might come, change the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might not,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Can you say it with one hundred percent certainty he will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re friends, close allies.  I&#8217;m his right hand.  Things would have to be in bad shape for him to not be able or willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re in pretty bad shape, Daddy.  You said that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>It all felt very different, now that he wasn&#8217;t actively working on the problem.  The quiet, the break from it all.  He wasn&#8217;t sure he could endure it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assignment.  Last warning,&#8221; the teacher said.</p>
<p>He looked at the sheet, then handed it to Liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a strategy,&#8221; America said, leaning forward.  &#8220;I vote we come up with the worst, most Aristocrats level wrong answer, and then we figure out what the opposite of that would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your kid is screaming in a shopping aisle, wanting to get candy.  When you refuse, he shouts out you aren&#8217;t his parent, the entire store hears, how do you handle that situation?&#8221; Liberty read out loud.  &#8220;I say we tell him that&#8217;s right, we aren&#8217;t, and then sell him to the Dark Fall courts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleshmongler, honey,&#8221; America said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a bodysnatcher that&#8217;ll swap his body with their old, crusty one, and <em>then</em> sell them to a fleshmongler.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it wouldn&#8217;t be that quiet.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;Verona&#8217;s not coming,&#8221; Lucy reported, as she checked her phone.  &#8220;She got on a call with her mom and she wants to keep talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom nodded.  &#8220;Good.  I mean, it would have been nice to have her company, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm hmmm.  Do you think she&#8217;s telling her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Lucy answered.  &#8220;Not with- lots of reasons.  But I don&#8217;t think her mom would believe her.  I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d believe over a phone call even if you and me and Avery and Avery&#8217;s parents were all saying it.  There&#8217;s a barrier you have to push past.  But even if we ignored that that, like&#8230; it makes life weirder for her mom, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if something happens or her mom gets scared like you did with Cherrypop in the kitchen, then&#8230; does Verona go over there?  Does she call Avery and pull Avery away from her life, so Avery&#8217;s dealing with her own mom <em>and </em>Verona&#8217;s mom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t- I know she&#8217;s your best friend, and I know it would hurt things, but I also don&#8217;t think it would be the worst thing ever if she went to live with her mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>That hurt.</p>
<p>That really hurt.  Lucy drew her shoulders together, and felt acutely aware again of how the sweater she was wearing wasn&#8217;t <em>hers</em>.</p>
<p>Her mom cupped a hand around the back of Lucy&#8217;s neck and bent down, kissing the top of her forehead.  &#8220;I know.  I know, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s changed a lot.  I&#8217;ve been with her through most of this and- except for her being away, or her going to focus on Kennet below, I&#8217;ve been with her through all of it.  And she changed this much.  And it&#8217;s like- even while I&#8217;m watching-&#8221;</p>
<p>The doorbell rang.</p>
<p>Lucy followed her mom to the front hall.  &#8220;-there&#8217;ve been these things that felt like- like I only barely caught her before she did something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom stopped with a hand on the doorknob.  &#8220;Is it okay to talk about this with a guest around or-?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  After?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>The door opened.  Liberty was on the other side. She wore a white t-shirt under a suit jacket, with jeans, hair in a ponytail.  She held out a handful of flowers in a cone of newspaper.  &#8220;Thank you for having me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh thank you.  You didn&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My daddy brings liquor, wine for some people and whiskey for others, and I could&#8217;ve got some, but I figured that&#8217;d be weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a bit concerning,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;Come in, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a very nice home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved from the front hall to the open-concept kitchen, which sort of blended into the dining area, with big windows looking out on the back porch and backyard.  Lucy&#8217;s mom checked on the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to ask, I know this is a weird request-&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p><em>Oh no</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;-could I invite someone to dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got food, but-&#8221;  Lucy&#8217;s mom looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human or goblin?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goblin.  It&#8217;s totally okay to say no, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I can get them to be good.  There&#8217;s a story, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was looking after a bunch of kids at the Blue Heron, when everything was falling apart, supervision wasn&#8217;t really all there, even gave some lessons.  And then things fell apart, right?  Is this okay to talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I tried to keep in touch with kids, but stuff was hard.  Some of the kids, they come from weird and strict families, and I worried about &#8217;em, so I sent some of my little helpers out to check on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Liberty had a kind of nervous energy, with more emphasis on the energy than the nervousness, and it seemed to intensify with Lucy&#8217;s response.  &#8220;I guess, yeah!  I was just worried, mainly.  And this one, she went all the way out to this one kid, to bring him some books I liked, and she did a really super job, brought the books intact, even after getting mugged on the way, and then she hung around with the kid when she didn&#8217;t have to.  I want to reward her but I&#8217;m worried that depending on where she goes or if I end up heading back to daddy&#8217;s where we don&#8217;t generally allow random goblins on the premises-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Wait, but goblins are your thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a thing but they can be a thing that takes over, and if you have three goblins you can end up with five and then ten.  Especially with me and &#8216;Meri.  And the houses have nice things, so I kinda get it.  I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to getting my own place so I don&#8217;t have to sweat it, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, uh,&#8221; Lucy replied, a bit at a loss for words.  She looked at her mom.  &#8220;Maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this a good, uh, example for a goblin?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  I think so,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess?&#8221; Lucy offered, unsure.  Maybe it would be a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just call &#8217;em at the backyard,&#8221; Liberty said, hesitating for a second to verify that was okay, before going.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s nervous,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom observed, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot going on.  Her sister, family&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewdtube!&#8221; Liberty hollered outside, hands cupped at her mouth.  &#8220;Lewdtube!  Lewdtube!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewdtube,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom commented, shaking her head.</p>
<p>Lewdtube showed up, bounding across the porch.  She was built like a mostly hairless ferret, long and somewhat flexible in the body but with short limbs and a rat tail, and she had a face that was halfway between a ferret and a frog.  Her ears weren&#8217;t especially pointed, but scraggly hair came together in tufts at the end of each, making them look longer than they were.  Liberty picked her up and murmured some words.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Want to have dinner with me and these people?  And us hanging out can be your present?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;They&#8217;ve had experiences with ruder, mean goblins, so let&#8217;s change things up in a weird way by being super good, okay?  And a lot of the time, when a goblin is really good, it&#8217;s only so they can pull a prank right or do something rude or awful right at the end, but we won&#8217;t.  If we do it right, it&#8217;ll be great.  <em>So</em> ironic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewdtube was suppressing giggles.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Come on.  If you don&#8217;t know what to do to be polite, follow my lead.  Here.  Let&#8217;s give you these&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When Liberty stood up and stepped away from Lewdtube, the goblin had little bows on her ear-tufts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Verona coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s busy with a family thing.&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Family,&#8221; Liberty replied.  &#8220;Oh man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing, I think, for Verona.  You doing okay?  I know this is a lot.  We appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s America, she&#8217;s needed a serious chill pill for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chill pill up the-&#8221; Lewdtube started, then paused.  &#8220;Street- uh, there might be a pharmacy.  I wonder if they sell them there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a good thought,&#8221; Liberty said, picking up the goblin.  &#8220;Do we have something like phone books we could stack on the chair for my girl here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The goblin twisted around to flop over, head on Liberty&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; Lucy replied.  &#8220;Here, uh&#8230; some old ones.  We tear out pages for starting the fireplace.  They&#8217;re not that big, though.  Small town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some old dictionaries on the bottom shelf,&#8221; her mom pointed out.  &#8220;And we have a lot of very terrible books in the- I don&#8217;t even know what to call it.  The reading room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lost reading room?&#8221; Lucy suggested.  &#8220;It&#8217;s Found, not Lost, but Lost sounds way better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very cool,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you want me to do up something like a portal that we can cover up?&#8221; Lucy told her mom.  &#8220;So you can go when you want without my help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you think works.  I trust you with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which chair is good for L.T.?&#8221; Liberty asked, holding the first few books.  &#8220;I should sit next to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there.  Here, I&#8217;ll set the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy headed upstairs, to her room, because it was the space she was most comfortable with drawing on the wall, and drew a portal.  Then she had to let it take her through and go all the way down to the sub-floor.  She got some of the biggest books.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if she could hear what was being said in the kitchen in Kennet above.  Her mom, Liberty, and a goblin there.</p>
<p>She hurried up, arms full.  By the time she got back to the kitchen, the books were sliding out of her arms.  Liberty caught them and helped her put them on the end of the table before they fell to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate you working for me,&#8221; Lewdtube said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weirdly phrased but nice sentiment,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>The goblin giggled to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just saying.  Is a second goblin okay, in Verona&#8217;s seat?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised him some one-on-one time since he was taking on some extra work, running interference while I traveled by Warren,&#8221; Liberty added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And one goblin becomes two?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;We were just talking about how that happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can say no,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying no.  Just&#8230; observing,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;If he&#8217;s good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep it strictly to two,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;And maybe if you can, avoid screaming something strange that the neighbors will hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not strange,&#8221; Liberty said, as she went over to the back door.  &#8220;Flopsy!  Flopsy!  Flopsy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still loud,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom noted.</p>
<p>Liberty grunted as she picked up the goblin.  He looked like a rabbit had been crossbred with a brick and the result was very unhappy about the whole situation.  Dour, jowly expression, dense, and covered in light, uneven, spiky fur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flopsy-&#8221; Liberty grunted.  &#8220;-weighs a lot more than you&#8217;d think.  But he&#8217;s helped me out lots.  Leads one of my raiding parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raiding?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I need to send my goblins out to go after someone or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have to do that a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to reduce my mom&#8217;s stress over this entire thing,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet, as she helped with organizing the books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a <em>ton</em>.  It&#8217;s like, uh, if you go out into the woods and there&#8217;s a bear, sometimes you need some bluster to get the bear to back down.  A bunch of barking dogs work.  Except what we&#8217;re talking about is smarter than a bear.  And definitely sometimes smarter than a dog, right?&#8221; Liberty asked, as she plunked Flopsy down on a stack of books, on one chair at the kitchen island, where the chairs were almost like stools, they were tall enough.  Lucy had worried the books would slide out, but Flopsy weighed enough to press them down and maximize friction.  Seventy five pounds of goblin in a twenty pound package.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worrying,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;Things smarter than bears, but just as dangerous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just gotta know how to navigate it all, and I think we do okay,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucy agreed.</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom brought food to the table as they got the goblins set up.  &#8220;Schnitzels and mashed cauliflower.  Some greens, I put some asparagus to the side.  I know it&#8217;s not for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy did her best to look innocent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Liberty asked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the more bitter vegetable tastes, I dunno.  I&#8217;ll eat &#8217;em, but given an option&#8230; usually give it a pass, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty leaned down for the goblins, murmuring.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Can make your pee stink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lemon slices for the schnitzels, along with spicy mustard and straight hot sauce,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not <em>that</em> hot,&#8221; Lucy added, seeing Liberty turn her interest to the hot sauce.  &#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe bet when it comes to Liberty and goblins is to think they want to go to an extreme, I guess, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually!&#8221; Liberty replied.  &#8220;Yeah.  Really hot hot sauce is cool, but this is super nice too.  I actually haven&#8217;t had home cooking for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could&#8217;ve guessed from the sharp teeth.  Does that- is that okay?  Does that hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes!  When I breathe in wrong or drink something cold.  Nerves exposed here and there.  But it&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to have braces.  Those were worse.  I cut them out because they were driving me around the bend.  Was a cool aesthetic for a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has magic for dealing with little nuisances,&#8221; Lucy pointed out.  &#8220;Minor cuts, scrapes, nerve pain&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  It&#8217;s great.  Actually, uh, Sir Toadswallow was the one who taught me that.  I was a little tomboy, skinned my knees while wearing those clunky four-wheel rollerskates, and we had a nanny who was fussing over me, and while she was getting things to get me cleaned up, drying the tears from my face, and America was getting grumpy at me, telling me not to cry, Toadswallow was the one who sat next to me and he&#8217;s asked me, &#8216;<em>do you want a hug and comfort, or do you want some magic?</em>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you took the magic?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!  Totally.  That poor nanny couldn&#8217;t keep up with me after.  There wasn&#8217;t anything slowing me down for a while after that.  Climbing trees, jumping off things I shouldn&#8217;t, <em>crazy</em> wipeouts.  This smells delicious, by the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It smells real good,&#8221; Lewdtube said, her head and shoulders barely over the upper edge of the plate.  &#8220;Can I have lots of asparagus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Liberty stage-whispered, hand at her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goblin giggled madly as the asparagus was heaped onto her plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much you all eat.  Verona eats like a bird.   Here, do you want to serve yourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.  That works.  Flopsy is pretty much a guarantee you won&#8217;t have leftovers if you don&#8217;t want any.  It all just kind of compacts in there, you&#8217;d be surprised how much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you goblins normally eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trash!&#8221; Lewdtube exclaimed.  &#8220;Uhh, nothing as nice as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good one,&#8221; Liberty said, winking at the goblin.  The goblin grinned up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.  I&#8217;m glad you approve,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said, looking weirded out.  &#8220;You said you haven&#8217;t had home cooking in a while, Liberty?  What do <em>you</em> normally do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really depends where I&#8217;m at.  The Blue Heron is pretty nice, but after the Blue Heron I was with my daddy for a short while, and we eat at restaurants when we&#8217;re all together.  Then I was at one of the houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Uh.  One of the ones without any chefs on staff.  It was actually a lot like this one, but not as nice.  Just me, and the goblins who wouldn&#8217;t make much of a mess, and my daddy leaves me money.  I mostly get what&#8217;s easy and goblin-compatible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you all on your own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah.  It&#8217;s cool though.  My dad works, I can fend for myself.  Got enough wilderness training under my belt, I could survive just about anywhere, no problem, a house in a nice neighborhood with a budget and people who come in once every three days to clean or check on the property, whether I&#8217;m there or not?  Easy peasy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And America?  Was she with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty, mouth full, shook her head.  She swallowed.  &#8220;Been busy.  With everything going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understandable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the way things went at the Blue Heron really messed her up.  We had Toadswallow when we were kids and then he left us, and that&#8217;s around the time daddy was getting busy, and I think America was really hurt by that.  And then she didn&#8217;t really have a replacement until Alexander.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The headmaster?  Bell-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belanger,&#8221; Lucy clarified.  <em>Please don&#8217;t get into the circumstances of death</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s the one who passed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lucy said, dropping her eyes.</p>
<p>This conversation felt like a minefield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re super on the ball with all this!&#8221; Liberty said, excited.  To her left, Flopsy had his mouth level to the plate&#8217;s edge, and was using a fork to slide the food into.  His eyes rolled up to look at Liberty.  Liberty leaned forward.  &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you only learn about all of this really recently?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very recently.  But my daughter was kind enough to give me the notes she&#8217;s been taking along the way.  And if your teenage daughter ever gives you a pile of reading material that&#8217;s all, &#8216;this is everything intense, weird, and crazy that&#8217;s going on in my life&#8217;, well, you read it, don&#8217;t you?  You go over it twice, and you take your own notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like you&#8217;re- like you&#8217;re, uh, you&#8217;re super into it, right?  You&#8217;re excited, you really want to figure out what she&#8217;s about?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  Absolutely.  Naturally.  &#8216;Into it&#8217; and &#8216;excited&#8217; might not be the exact right words, but yes.  I care, I&#8217;m invested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Toadswallow was that for us.  We&#8217;ve had tutors for forever, in one of the main houses we&#8217;ve got three people who live there and they like, they look after the innocent library, and they talk about how they&#8217;re going to educate us, assess what we&#8217;re missing, what we gotta do.  Personal trainer, same deal.  Consults with daddy.  But they don&#8217;t-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go to regular school?  Sorry, I&#8217;m interrupting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.  Public school.  When not at the Blue Heron.  But we alternate regular and magic school so the tutors sometimes help us to catch up, and they&#8217;re on staff and they sometimes travel to wherever we are.  Sometimes to be supervision.  And sometimes there&#8217;s one at one house and two at another, and guest tutors sometimes.  Um, but what I was saying, is for them, it&#8217;s very cut and dry.  Like there&#8217;s a certain bar they have to get us to meet and they get us there.  You know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that at regular school too,&#8221; Lucy noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, for sure!&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Yeah, right, exactly.  Yeah.  But then there&#8217;s Toadswallow and he was all&#8230; genuinely excited, and interested, and it wasn&#8217;t like, you ask a question, get an answer, tutor makes a note.  You can ask him stuff and he&#8217;ll give you more than you asked for.  Like he thought we could pull anything off.  And then I guess he didn&#8217;t anymore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not exactly how it happened, I think.  I think he still sees potential in you,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we should change the subject,&#8221; Liberty said, looking momentarily uncomfortable.  A tension had appeared in her that made Lucy think she&#8217;d touched a nerve.</p>
<p>Which she hadn&#8217;t.  She was trying to pull things <em>away</em> from the nerve.  But it was that touchy.</p>
<p>Liberty looked down at her goblins.  &#8220;You guys good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is real good.  Thank you,&#8221; Lewdtube said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very welcome,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, uh, changing the subject away from Toadswallow,&#8221; Liberty said, in a very &#8216;I can&#8217;t help it&#8217; way, &#8220;but saying what I was going to say, I think Alexander was kind of that for &#8216;Meri, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>And we&#8217;re back to the subject of Alexander.  And I haven&#8217;t quite told my mom that John shot him.</em></p>
<p><em>I will, but things have been&#8230; tough.</em></p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom gave her a sympathetic look.  &#8220;That&#8217;s hard.  Any death is.  Especially for someone who sees potential in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  That&#8217;s it.  Potential.  More America than me, though.  And like, she&#8217;s old enough, it&#8217;s uncool to go to daddy for that kind of thing.  I can though.  But don&#8217;t tell on me.  I know it&#8217;s a bit kiddish, and I can&#8217;t pull it off for that much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s kiddish to value your parents&#8217; attention and support,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re biased,&#8221; Lucy muttered, which got a chuckle out of her mom and Liberty.  Lewdtube saw Liberty chuckling and laughed, out of tune of the moment.  Liberty gave her a stroke on the head, then did the same for Flopsy, who&#8217;d leaned over a few inches toward Liberty, almost at the point of falling off the chair.  His eyes closed as she scratched the full length of one his floppy, absurdly thin and long bunny ears, that didn&#8217;t suit the rest of him.</p>
<p>It all felt a bit heavy, though.  Like, couldn&#8217;t literally anyone who was sitting in on this conversation see that there was a huge gap here?  That Anthem Tedd wasn&#8217;t helping Liberty at all, basically?  That Liberty was reacting to that?</p>
<p>Or maybe she was the biased one.  Maybe Lucy&#8217;s experiences of being let down meant she couldn&#8217;t assess these things fairly.</p>
<p>It still felt heavy.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, L.T.?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.  &#8220;I hear you did a good deed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did?&#8221; L.T. asked, eyes widening, as she looked around, reacting in the same way another person would if they&#8217;d been caught naked in public.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking books to a little- boy, was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; Liberty confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then spending time with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah!  I forgot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re hanging out tonight,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhhhhh&#8230;&#8221; the goblin drew out the sound.  Lucy could pretty much see the goblin coming up with five ideas and deciding to drop them for one reason or another.  &#8220;Walked in the woods to um, to a secret spot.  Played in a field.  Talked.  He read books to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you read Camp Stamp?  I sent him those.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read those when I was little,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Paul- read me the first one, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; her mother confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ex stepdad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gotcha, gotcha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like you&#8217;re doing terrific, L.T.  And- Flopsy, was it?  I like your name more than a lot of the other goblin names.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flopsy sat there, body and head still, eyes roving around, looking like he didn&#8217;t want to be put on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I bothering him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good for him,&#8221; Liberty said.  She poked Flopsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye,&#8221; Flopsy said, not even a full word, but a half of a confirmation, voice deep.  &#8220;I&#8217;m Flops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a soldier, a general?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I raid.  Run fast, hit stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that kind of leads me to other questions.  Like how dangerous this all is, and how dangerous what&#8217;s happening tonight is,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;I think about what happened to Avery and her dad- sorry.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s alright to bring up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?  Clarify?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sister.  Attacking them at the ice cream place.  They called you partway through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  What happened, exactly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They got hurt.  Connor still has a bit of a bruise around his nose, slight black eyes.  Avery had a cut on her stomach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Well&#8230; balls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewdtube hurried to get to a standing position, going hand-over-hand along the table&#8217;s edge to better reach where Liberty&#8217;s hand was, the full length of her body stretched out so she could touch.  &#8220;Mind your manners.  Swearing, gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very right, L.T.,&#8221; Liberty said.  She gave the goblin a pat, and helped her sit back down, lifting the goblin&#8217;s upper body back over.  &#8220;Well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goblin, smiling, looked like she could barely contain herself.</p>
<p>Flopsy sat there like a bump on a log, dour, eyes very concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, does L.T. want seconds?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No thank you,&#8221; Lewdtube replied, struggling more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Flopsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flopsy&#8217;s good, I think,&#8221; Liberty answered for him.  &#8220;I meant what I said, you could have a whole pig on your table and I think he could polish it off.  He&#8217;s nigh-bottomless.  It&#8217;d just help him be a little wrecking ball.  Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave Flopsy&#8217;s ears a good scratch, and he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about you two?  If not, I can put it away.  Liberty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This was good enough it almost brought tears to my eyes, but I shouldn&#8217;t get too full, if I&#8217;m going to be out there.  Just in case I can&#8217;t convince &#8216;Meri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I want to say I&#8217;m really worried about how you&#8217;re talking about this.  About the danger, that you&#8217;re preparing for a fight.  Are the Dog Tags going to be there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; Lucy replied.  &#8220;Most of them are going to be handling the main thing, which is meant to take our attention so we aren&#8217;t aware of the big goblin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t like that we&#8217;re talking tactics and diversions.  There&#8217;s nobody else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty&#8217;s the only one who can really talk straight to America,&#8221; Lucy said, because that was easier than talking about the other half of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toadswallow can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toadswallow tried.  While dressed up as a human, at the ice cream place.  It didn&#8217;t really work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dressed up how?&#8221; L.T. asked, sitting up.  &#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A super secret trick very few goblins would ever think of using,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us talk about this, okay?&#8221; Liberty told the ferret-ish goblin.  &#8220;You deserve a voice but this is a sensitive topic.  I&#8217;ll reward you later because you were so wonderfully polite here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so weird how polite you are,&#8221; Lucy said, mocking some emotion, hands at the side of her head.</p>
<p>The goblin stifled giggles.</p>
<p>Flopsy sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be me,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m magicked up so I&#8217;m harder to hurt.  It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Verona&#8217;s helping,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;She stays out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Lucy?  Are you, Lucy?  Are you harder to hurt?  Are you staying out of the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>There it was.  Damn it.  Lucy had hoped to keep the focus on Liberty.  Vainly hoped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy sparred with America at the Blue Heron and won,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she spar with America with another twenty hostile, unpredictable practitioners around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sharp,&#8221; Liberty pointed out.</p>
<p>Lucy pinched the bridge of her nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t send Dog Tags?  Or Toadswallow, or the giant Fae?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have one idea on how to handle America.  I think I&#8217;m the only one who can pull it off.  If someone else comes to me and says they have a better idea and someone else can pull it off, I&#8217;m okay with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t have someone else, and they can&#8217;t, can they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we find out when we touch base with the Others,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;In the meantime, trust me?  I know- I know that&#8217;s really rotten to say when I was keeping secrets- I was forced to keep secrets, kind of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Liberty added, quiet.</p>
<p>Just a bit of backup was nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to come,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;To see, to be able to watch and make sure there&#8217;s really no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t-&#8221; Lucy started, stopped, then frowned.  &#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s not safe?  Then you absolutely shouldn&#8217;t be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not safe for <em>you</em>.  I can handle myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is asinine,&#8221; her mother retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help,&#8221; Lucy told Liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can help protect her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the help I wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Liberty,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super cool that your mom wants to see you in action, though.  I love that,&#8221; Liberty gushed.  &#8220;I wish my daddy came to more of my things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Liberty, no.  Mom, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  And no tricks, no connection blocks, none of that.  Okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Okay?</em>  Say it, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy groaned again.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is fun,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;And this was delicious.  Thank you Mrs. Ellingson.  That is your name, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so unusual, I hope you don&#8217;t mind my saying so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mishmash of Lucy&#8217;s father&#8217;s and mine, when we were married.  We didn&#8217;t find anything especially elegant, and we went forward with this, with the thought that it would sound more natural if we got used to it.  And it didn&#8217;t, especially, but I&#8217;m okay with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except I had to confirm I spelled it right twice, when getting my first bank account,&#8221; Lucy muttered.  &#8220;And when signing up for the Blue Heron.  Not that I&#8217;m complaining, exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ours,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  For sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy wasn&#8217;t even sure how to get into things, especially thinking about what the rest of the night had in store.</p>
<p>Her sweater nagged at her.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get ready.  If we&#8217;re done?  Is that okay, may I be excused?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;Talk to people.  Triple check there&#8217;s no alternatives to you being involved.  <em>Please.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please and thank you!&#8221; Lewdtube piped up, earning a head pat from Liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us at least check the coast is clear before you come, okay?&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as you promise you won&#8217;t try to run off or avoid me.  Don&#8217;t cheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head.  &#8220;I won&#8217;t promise, but I won&#8217;t cheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys can watch her until we give the signal,&#8221; Liberty offered.</p>
<p>Lucy left, glancing back to see Liberty happily chatting away with her mom, pulling Flopsy into her lap to scratch his head with the fingernails of both hands.</p>
<p>Lucy went up to her room, fixing up her hair again, pulling loose, dense curls back into the ponytail where they&#8217;d escaped, before redoing the back and putting on a brass-toned hairband that matched her earring.</p>
<p>A bit of glamour adjusted the tone of the weapon ring.  She fixed the chain with John&#8217;s dog tag and the black dog&#8217;s ring on it.</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>Spell cards, some of the dwindling supply of High Summer glamour.  She didn&#8217;t even have Dark Fall glamour anymore, except from the remnants of past transformations &#8211; feathers that she&#8217;d used before that still had traces on them.  Maybe good for one transformation in a pinch.  Maybe.  She could slip into the shapes of more aggressive birds and animals, but that was tricky, and a lot of the time she didn&#8217;t want to be aggressive.  She wanted to become animals to get places or get away.</p>
<p>High Summer was just a bit worse for that.</p>
<p>In a month or two, the supplies would run out and she&#8217;d have to face the tougher stuff with Winter glamour, and Guilherme taking an even sterner approach.</p>
<p>She plucked at the collar of her sweater.  It wasn&#8217;t <em>bad</em>.  The black, dense knit suited her, even, maybe.  But the shape of the collar and the blown-out sleeves and the way it felt so&#8230; lived in or maybe intentionally worn out, it just didn&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>So she used glamour.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d worked with Chloe&#8217;s sweater and that had been different, but some principles were the same.  She followed the weave.</p>
<p>Changing the collar.  Adding a hood.  Changing the color.  Changing the texture.</p>
<p>She had bead-chain necklaces in case she broke the one with John&#8217;s tag and Yalda&#8217;s ring on it, and took some, working them into the glamour and fabric.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Your daughter is really amazing, you know.  Not as amazing as Avery, I&#8217;ll say that, but I&#8217;m a bit biased.  Avery&#8217;s got an <em>amazing</em> &#8216;possum.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Uh huh.  I&#8217;m not sure how to respond to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty!&#8221; Lucy called down the stairs.</p>
<p>There were some running footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up!?&#8221; Liberty called up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me with some prep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy pulled off the sweater, leaving on a sleeveless top.  She looked it over before hanging it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Lucy said, getting a notebook out and setting it aside.  &#8220;Might as well layer defenses, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure.  On skin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan.  Done it before.  Unless it&#8217;s a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy handed Liberty the brassy-gold metallic marker.</p>
<p>Chainmail hooded sweater, runes on her neck and arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for trusting me to do this,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;And for the nice dinner.  It&#8217;s been a bit lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to be a common thing these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shivered at the cold marker at the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;This feels like overkill,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might not be.  Are you going to be okay if it&#8217;s not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drawing continued for a few minutes.  Lucy heard her mom downstairs, trying to make conversation with the goblins, before they got down from their seats and went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incoming, in three, two&#8230;&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Liberty pulled the marker away before Flopsy could tackle-hug her leg, then resumed drawing.</p>
<p>Liberty&#8217;s phone rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my dad.  I&#8217;m going to- I&#8217;ll step outside, I think.  You mind not listening in?  I&#8217;m not betraying you or anything.  It&#8217;s just family stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty left, and Lucy&#8217;s mom came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there enough done by Liberty, or is it clear enough for you to finish that up?&#8221; she asked her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I get it wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s one protection that might not work.  That I hopefully won&#8217;t need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.  Maybe have Liberty check after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>It reminded her of her mom doing her hair.  Except it was- what?  Her mom putting armor on her daughter?</p>
<p>It felt somber, sad, cold instead of warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our conversation earlier.  About Verona,&#8221; her mother said.  &#8220;Times you stopped her from doing something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  She&#8217;s really good at the magic stuff.  Really, really good.  I don&#8217;t think she even gets how good she is.  But there are times she goes too far, or it- if I wasn&#8217;t there, to pull her back, she&#8217;d go past a point of no return.  Avery helps sometimes, but&#8230; different personality, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So if she leaves, what if there&#8217;s another moment like that, and I&#8217;m not there to tell her she can&#8217;t be a cat instead of a human?  Or to not use the big red button in the lobby of the hospital?  Or- I don&#8217;t know.  It feels shitty and condescending that I&#8217;m saying this, even, but we have our strengths and weaknesses, you know?  And Avery&#8217;s- she&#8217;s good out there.  In the flanks, supporting from three hours away, staying in touch with us and key people.  I don&#8217;t think Verona would be okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother finished, then smoothed out Lucy&#8217;s hair some, before fixing the hairband.  &#8220;But is she okay like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno.  But I&#8217;d rather &#8216;dunno&#8217; with her where I can do everything I can to back her up than not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And- I have to ask.  You don&#8217;t want me to come tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I&#8217;m still coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Figured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m left wondering&#8230; you&#8217;re watching out for Verona, but who&#8217;s watching out for you?  Because Miss has her own thing to focus on, right?  Guilherme is in winter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  Fallen to winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  And Toadswallow didn&#8217;t seem that supportive of Liberty and America, and I&#8217;m left wondering if he&#8217;ll leave you in the lurch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He loves them.  It&#8217;s complicated.  It&#8217;s not like she thinks it is.  Her dad threatened him, and Toadswallow didn&#8217;t want to tell her.  Don&#8217;t tell her that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s earring was off, but she knew Liberty and the goblins were still downstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who watches you, Lucy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me.  I&#8217;ve always had to watch myself extra,&#8221; Lucy said.  She pulled on the hidden chainmail glamoured sweater, letting it settle on her markered-up shoulders, with brassy-gold marker on black skin.  &#8220;Because I know too many other people are watching me, waiting for me to slip up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the world I wanted for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy reached with her right hand around to the left side of her neck, until she was touching the diagram work.</p>
<p><em>For Kennet.</em></p>
<p>It activated.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Me either.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>“Yeah, and Avery’s been talking to a lot of people. Word on the street, according to her, is that my daddy’s on his way into Kennet tonight,” Liberty explained.</p>
<p>They were walking over toward the cabins now.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.  That had been the phone call Liberty had stepped outside to take.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, well, shit,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;So what do we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to try to convince America,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;If we can do that before he shows up, that&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you can&#8217;t, I make my move?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Do what you can to stop the big guy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaygarrrrrr Who Slavishly Slays.  Don&#8217;t talk around his name or avoid saying it while talking about him, or you&#8217;ll get in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is lame,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <em>great,</em> Verona countered.  &#8220;Lame-great.  Imagine if someone had to call me Verona Hayward, third Witch, sorceress and hatcher of the moon-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my god,&#8221; Lucy groaned, but it was a groan in good fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;-wielder of halflight and shadow, mutable of form, seller of strange texts&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re adding to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>totally</em> adding to it, even if I can&#8217;t make it this ridiculous mouthful I can&#8217;t make others say.  What&#8217;s the point if you can&#8217;t have a whole formalized thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>They arrived at the part of the street where they could look between hospital and school and see the cabins at the foot of the ski hill, nature behind them, crushed gravel lots in front of them.</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s earring caught the approaching Dog Tags, goblins, Rook, and Matthew.</p>
<p>Toadswallow wasn&#8217;t here, nor was Bubbleyum.  Probably figured it&#8217;d upset Liberty.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Stay ahead of things if they manage to get a signal across?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re heading downtown, Kennet above.  Liberty&#8217;s in Kennet below,&#8221; Rook said.  &#8220;They intend to take action in about an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.  The group split along prearranged lines, but didn&#8217;t separate.  The Dog Tags were with Verona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Grandfather come with me?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Grandfather asked.  &#8220;Not saying no, but why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I like you and trust you?  And it sure would be nice to have people I like and trust at my back for this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Grandfather said.  &#8220;While you&#8217;re wearing the tag and ring you&#8217;re wearing, you can get away with asking pretty much anything.  You don&#8217;t have to explain, but-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a person.  You deserve explanations.  I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have a good one.  I just&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She trailed off, aware of the number of eyes on her.</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;re the closest thing I have to John.</em></p>
<p>He moved over, into Lucy&#8217;s smaller group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you need me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mom&#8217;s coming,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have my guys protecting her, but she might want someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What purpose does it serve?&#8221; Rook asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes her feel better, I dunno,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;She wants to see.  And I don&#8217;t know if I want her to see, but&#8230; I dunno.  Either this goes horribly and it sure would be nice to have my mom and some people I trust around, or it goes great and maybe my mom feels better about what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or both,&#8221; Verona threw in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really adding to the stress here, Ronnie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to her, okay?  Then I&#8217;ll talk to my dad when he comes.  That&#8217;s two shots we get at fixing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy had her suspicions, but she didn&#8217;t really want to put the suspicions to words.  She was afraid she could understand where America was at.</p>
<p>If losing Alexander was some loose parallel to Lucy losing someone&#8230; if that happened, and then if she&#8217;d been in the midst of it all, of the hurt and anger, and then someone she really trusted like Booker or Avery or Verona turned their backs on her?</p>
<p>Even if it was for a good reason, she didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d turn around and offer a listening ear.</p>
<p>Liberty announced, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go.  We&#8217;ll check the way is clear, call your mom.  I&#8217;ll try with America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>She and her group followed Liberty as Liberty walked across the field between the school and hospital.  Verona&#8217;s group headed toward downtown.</p>
<p>Liberty put her fingers to her lips, and then she whistled, an enhanced sound, loud and piercing enough Lucy imagined it could be heard across Kennet.</p>
<p>The goblins came out of every gap, every trash can, every dark shadow under a bush that had captured some plastic bags blown by the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we draw a portal?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;I guess we can do that more, right, because the reason we weren&#8217;t drawing them was because they upset the imbalance, and we&#8217;re balanced now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or we could use the Warrens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could.&#8221;  Rook pointed out, &#8220;There&#8217;s also a way from Kennet above to Kennet below over there, near the south end of the valley, it&#8217;s one of the big routes they found they&#8217;ve been using.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do that,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Show we aren&#8217;t afraid.  Let her hear we&#8217;re coming and then we meet on sorta neutral terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy wasn&#8217;t sure she agreed, but this was Liberty&#8217;s part of this.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t really have to work very hard to find the spot.  Practitioners were already there, along with two Others who were keeping to the shadows, staying out of sight when civilians passed by.</p>
<p>They adjusted to full alert as Liberty approached, backed by Lucy and the rest of the Kennet group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Tedd,&#8221; Hadley called out.</p>
<p>Lucy caught Liberty&#8217;s &#8216;ugh&#8217; with the earring.  She wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it without.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m passing through for my sister.  Let me through?  Family matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the army of goblins and the group behind you part of the family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider my raiders and helpers to be part of the extended family.  Right now they&#8217;re emotional support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the emotion they&#8217;re supporting going to be violent rage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends on a lot.  Hopefully and probably not.  Let us through.  We want to deal with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can be taken two ways, you know.  Deal like negotiate, or deal like&#8230; pounding face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way, Hadley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only because Anthem&#8217;s your daddy, and he&#8217;s cozy with Musser.  You know he&#8217;s coming, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of why I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hadley motioned, and the group of practitioners went through the portal.</p>
<p>Liberty waited a minute, then walked through, goblins bounding forward to go through a few steps ahead, or behind, and then flooded through, into a dark bend in the path through trees.</p>
<p>Lucy could taste the difference in the air as she followed.  Black smoke thick in the air.</p>
<p>Hadley&#8217;s group was a distance up the way, walking over toward the cabins.  Their breath fogged in the cool fall air.</p>
<p>As they approached the cabins, America stepped outside.  Others were already outside, in neighboring cabins, or right behind her.</p>
<p>Liberty reached the edge of where the grass started becoming crushed gravel as America reached the halfway point.  America had the sides of her head shaved, hair in almost a mullet, and was sucking purple fluid out of a 2-gallon jug of syrup and crushed ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a deal, &#8216;Meri,&#8221; Liberty called out.  &#8220;Not to let our sisterhood slip away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really being a whole cunt over that, you know?  All this while, dragging me around, bringing it up to get your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your way.  There&#8217;s been enough times I didn&#8217;t want to go with it and I did.  I&#8217;m asking you to come with me.  You&#8217;re pissed now because you were pissed before and tomorrow you&#8217;ll be pissed off because you can&#8217;t get over how pissed you were today.  Chill out.  Let&#8217;s tell dad to chill, let&#8217;s go home, let&#8217;s wake up the neighborhood with loud goblin weapons.  We&#8217;ll make wild plans for Halloween with the goblins.  Let&#8217;s stay up talking until we fall asleep, then do it the next night, until shit starts making sense&#8230; or it&#8217;s nonsense we can face together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby Bitch,&#8221; America said.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t get it, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all gone to shit.  You&#8217;re pretending like we can go back to where things were and we can&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s <em>bad</em> out there.  We&#8217;re losing Lords, we&#8217;re losing friends- I don&#8217;t know if we have a home, anymore.  Not in this region.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we go somewhere else.  Wisconsin.&#8221;</p>
<p>America shook her head.  &#8220;Everything daddy&#8217;s been building.  Everything he was going to hand off to us.  The contact networks, libraries, troves- whatever&#8217;s still there, it&#8217;s going to get harder and harder to get to.  We don&#8217;t have halloween, we don&#8217;t have an easy place to rest or sleep.  A bunch of people left earlier, helped by the Others and nitwits behind you, and we can&#8217;t get in contact with them.  This isn&#8217;t just about the sister thing.  Remember when we spent three months preparing for zombie apocalypse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, of course I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the zombie bible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Memorized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chapter three, part-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-three,&#8221; Liberty finished.  &#8220;Fuck you.  Doesn&#8217;t apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn well does and fuck you too, this is <em>exactly</em> the situation the chapter was written for.  It&#8217;s all gone to shit, the world&#8217;s a mess, you need to stand with the tribe.  You&#8217;re furthest from center.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s straying.  Wasting resources-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really think Daddy&#8217;s going to agree with you?  When he shows?  Won&#8217;t be long.  The Carmine Exile is against us, if you were able to get here, it&#8217;s probably because he <em>let</em> you.  And why did he let you?  Because you&#8217;re against us.  Chapter three, part three.  Until we have basic needs met and a solid home base to fall back to, you gotta suck it up, put everything aside, work with the tribe.  Don&#8217;t let emotions or individual goals get in the way.  Tribe first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could give us a home base.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the heart of Carmine territory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you.  No way we can make the moves we need to make from here.  The closest port of call three hours away?  Under the Carmine&#8217;s watchful eye?  No way that works.  Gainsay me.  Tell me one good move you can make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty shook her head.  She looked over her shoulder at Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What good move can <em>you</em> make from here?&#8221; Lucy called out.  &#8220;Not such a good point if you&#8217;re <em>all</em> stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t butt in, kid!&#8221; America called out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Meri!&#8221; Liberty called out.  &#8220;This isn&#8217;t zombies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bullshit and you know it!  Chapter zero!  Alien invasions, war, breaking of the Seal, Primevals, we had a whole list!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Liberty answered, quieter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were going to have books for each possible endgame.  But same core ideas for each.  Planning for the big disasters.  Bibles to obey for each one.  We gave each one a different color.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we got bored, didn&#8217;t we?  Because it was so repetitive?  So we agreed?  A lot of it is the same!  And chapter three was one of those things!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a thing you did when you were kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still important,&#8221; Liberty said, looking a little defeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Important enough for you to&#8230;&#8221; Lucy trailed off, not wanting to put words to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Because &#8216;Meri is being a butt, and it doesn&#8217;t feel right.  Hey, Bitch!&#8221;</p>
<p>America, sucking on her drink, lowered the drink and stood straighter, looking about as intense as someone could look with purple stained lips and tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise we made to stay sisters takes priority over the Zombie Bible!  And you <em>know</em> you owe me at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A handful of little things does not add up to a Zombie Bible level event, Liberty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You attacked the person I like!  A bunch!  That&#8217;s a violation of the ethos, fuck it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you!  You know it is!  So fuck off, stop being butthurt, and be my sister again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I say no?&#8221; America asked.  &#8220;If this is too important?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty visibly shrank down into herself and back, fists clenched.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to declare the sisterly bond broken, we&#8217;re both forsworn,&#8221; America said.</p>
<p>There was no light in her eyes, Lucy saw.</p>
<p>Lucy looked over at Liberty- and there was a lot of light there.  Reflections of the lights from the cabin and the upper edge of downtown, the gas station up the mountain.  Captured in tears that sat at the edge of lower eyelids, that hadn&#8217;t yet escaped to her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Liberty replied, just as quiet.  &#8220;Thanks for telling me not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your ass over here, Liberty.  Daddy&#8217;s coming, then we leave, and this whole situation&#8217;ll look way different in the rear view mirror.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t like the shit you pull to get the TV remote all the time,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;If you want to play chicken, using the bond like that&#8230; you might get me to come over there, but you&#8217;ll never get me to forgive you.  Not completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>America didn&#8217;t answer right away.  She just stood there, stance askew, leaning a bit, condensation dripping off the paper cup with its plastic cover over the top, straw sticking out, expression neutral, eyes as lifeless as Liberty&#8217;s were wet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a once in a lifetime crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re being a thug, like Uncle Toadswallow warned us about.  He saw potential in us, he wanted us to make up new things to call ourselves, to be people who took cool practice and then did cool things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just shit they tell a lot of kids, Libs.  They tell you you have potential so you&#8217;ll try harder and maybe meet that potential.  But I don&#8217;t think they ever really <em>believe</em> it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> believe it.  For you and for me.  And for the kids I was hanging with, and for a lot of these goblins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll change your mind.  Let life disappoint you a few more times.  Let them disappoint you.  You&#8217;ll change your mind, Libs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>America shrugged.  &#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; frustrating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!?  Are you happy doing this!?  Because I get this sick feeling in my stomach on your behalf, and that&#8217;s secondhand!  I can&#8217;t imagine what you feel like right now!  Why would you want to be like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.  But if you were at least on the same page as me on this&#8230; we could talk.  It wouldn&#8217;t be like it was before, but we could talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty shook her head.</p>
<p>America added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for months for you.  I thought, everything going to shit like this, people dying, you&#8217;d show up, and we could talk.  Then you went straight to them, instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t apologize.  You&#8217;re not being fair, &#8216;Meri.  I deserve for you to put in the effort, at least <em>once, </em>follow me instead of me following you.</p>
<p>America stood there, heaving in a deep breath, then heaving it out.  A disgusted look crossed her face as she looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Meri?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s agree&#8230;&#8221; America ventured.  &#8220;The bond&#8217;s still there.  And that makes this all hurts a lot more.  Neither of us follows the other and it just hurts a fuckton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were making the Zombie Bible, it was fun, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; America asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t cross my mind, even the slightest bit, how bad it would feel when things got this bad.  Or that you and I wouldn&#8217;t be together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here.&#8221;</p>
<p>America nodded.  She turned her gaze to Lucy.  &#8220;<em>You</em> got something to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know why I&#8217;m here,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Libs?  Don&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a woman in the crowd back there.  I hereby swear to protect her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy turned.  Her mom was back there.  Grandfather and the goblins had guided her through.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s interfering, Libs.  I think somehow you missed the concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask you to,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>Liberty shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s annoying.  But okay,&#8221; America said.  &#8220;Let me pass that on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty nodded.  Her eyes were still wet.</p>
<p>America turned her back, walking a short distance to the cabins.  Lucy&#8217;s earring caught the faint whistle, and she saw the goblins escape out from the space beneath the cabin, and leave the woods.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t attack the crowd, it&#8217;ll get my little sister forsworn.  She&#8217;s a tit, but if you do that to her, you&#8217;d better do it to me too, because I&#8217;ll make it a lifelong vendetta to destroy you.  Pass that on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Next?  Slaygarrrrrr Who Slavishly Slays.  Time to kick some skinny black ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy watched as the pool of goblins surrounding America scrambled out of the way, cheering as Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays left the cabin, ducking his head to get through the door.</p>
<p>America talked to him as he squeezed through.  He had to turn sideways to get through the door, and even then, wood creaked as he pulled through.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t attack the crowd at the back.  And stick to the rules of the binding.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had legs like a rhino&#8217;s, covered in patchwork armor- some spiked, some decorated with strings of skulls, some just cast iron with various degrees of rust.  There might&#8217;ve been two cast iron frying pans, sans handle, each mounted on one side of the belt buckle, which was about a foot and a half across, depicting the same image that was on his helmet.</p>
<p>His right arm was similarly armored, but with more spikes, and a hand stuck out that was clawed, with dead gray skin stretched so thinly over the big hand that it had torn, exposing red, raw flesh.  Every unarmored part was like that- which included more than half his upper body and his left arm, where the flesh was stretched so thin it had split and looked like grayish ribbon.  Even with armored rhino legs, he was top heavy misproportioned, his arm and chest so swollen and <em>big</em> that they barely held the shape of a chest or arm.  At the inside of his elbow was a bulge of muscle or raw red fat -it was hard to tell- that was almost as big as Lucy would be if she curled up into a fetal position.</p>
<p>He had no neck- only a heaping bulge similar to the ones on his chest and arm, that gave loose shape and nothing more, with a cast iron helmet mounted diagonally on the side of it, beard draping down from the base of the helmet, matted, scraggly, and bloodstained.  Breath hissed out of the open part where his mouth was, a mess of random teeth, and the eyes seemed far too small, peering out of holes in the front of the helmet, that looked like they&#8217;d been made with weapons damaging the metal, instead of any actual design.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have permission to kick your sister&#8217;s ass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Wake her up from whatever the fuck the miserable dream she&#8217;s dreaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You better know my name!&#8221; he roared.</p>
<p>Goblins, friendly and enemy, and America, and Liberty, and various practitioners included, all answered.  &#8220;Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy added her voice to the cry, to be safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t sound like some of you knew it!&#8221; he roared, marching forward.</p>
<p>He got larger on the approach, swelling more.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it didn&#8217;t sound like some of you said it right!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy looked back at the crowd.  Her mom was shrinking back.</p>
<p><em>Sorry mom</em>.</p>
<p>She stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Slaygarrr Who Slavishly Slays roared.  He pointed a finger.  &#8220;You, I want you to say it, and say it right!&#8221;</p>
<p>Doglick answered, &#8220;Arf!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaygarrrrrrrr-arf!&#8221;</p>
<p>Slaygar reached behind his back, and pulled out a weapon that had about thirty spikes sticking out of the handle, and a massive stone stalactite mounted on the top, braced in place with metal bands.</p>
<p>Lucy kept moving forward, past Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays, turning to keep him firmly in her sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy saw Doglick concentrating.  &#8220;Slarf-arf-grrrrrrr-&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy threw a spell card at America.  Slaygarrr Who Slavishly Slays heaved his weapon, throwing it so it spun end over end, while simultaneously turning around.</p>
<p>Doglick scrambled, the goblins and Others around him parting.</p>
<p>The weapon turned in mid-air, to track Doglick as he ran.  And Slaygarrrr Who Slavishly Slays, meanwhile, kicked up a massive plume of dirt as he lunged, hurling himself toward America.</p>
<p>He went from being four or five paces behind Lucy to being about ten paces ahead, arm out to one side, where he caught the spell card.  It detonated in his hand.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t seem to care.  It barely did any damage.</p>
<p>Yep.  He was bound to protect America Tedd.</p>
<p>Lucy tossed down another spell card as he stomped toward her.</p>
<p>Light and smoke.  Bit of glamour- High Summer.  Not the best for smoke, but not the absolute worst either.  She traced the lines of the smoke, moving with it.  She shaped it, and encouraged the smoke to follow suit.</p>
<p>Every bit of the smoke began to resemble foxes, overlapping, dissipating, weaving into one another.</p>
<p>She let them scatter, rose as one-</p>
<p>Slaygarrrrrr who Slavishly Slays stomped, hard.</p>
<p>Glamour shattered, starting at the ground and rising.</p>
<p><em>Fuck, jesus.</em></p>
<p>Lucy reached for her pocket, and as the glamour around her shattered, pulled out the glamour packet, feathers still stuck in it.</p>
<p>Fifty-fifty on whether this would work, but she still had options and she&#8217;d <em>much</em> rather do this while she had options.</p>
<p>She became a bird.  And it wasn&#8217;t a perfect bird- she started out with one wing more formed than the other, flapped, and then glamour redistributed.</p>
<p>The hammer with a big spike for the head and thirty spikes along the handle zipped through the air, smacking into his hand, where it pierced through the palm and out the back of the hand in four different places.  In the process, it smashed right past Grandfather, who fell.</p>
<p><em>It returns to him</em>.</p>
<p>He reared back, ready to throw at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doglick&#8217;s still alive!&#8221; Liberty shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fucking interfere, Libs!&#8221; America hollered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221; Slaygarrrr who Slavishly Slays answered.  He pointed at Lucy.  &#8220;The Doglick won&#8217;t live if I can&#8217;t help it, and the glamour-swaddled cunt is to say my name!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a bird.  She wasn&#8217;t equipped to speak with this shitty secondhand glamour around her.</p>
<p>She flapped a few times, breaking the glamour, and reached for the air.  Guilherme had taught her this.  If she could slow her fall while she shouted-  &#8220;Slaygarrrr-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late!  A name this great deserves a prompt response!&#8221; Slaygarrrr Who Slavishly Slays interrupted.</p>
<p>He swelled even as he threw at Lucy.</p>
<p>She went for a spell card.  Two thirds of the way down, specifics didn&#8217;t matter much.</p>
<p>She threw it at the incoming hammer.</p>
<p>Water.  It produced a quantity of water that was instantly obliterated.  Droplets stung as they pelted her-</p>
<p>And the fogged watch at her ankle slowed time.</p>
<p>She tried to step on the hammer as it came at her, but it was wet, and her shoe skidded along the wet stone of the head.</p>
<p>But it did let her reorient-twisting her body through the air, so the smooth side of the head -still with a metal band fixing it to the haft- could slide down leg, banging knee slightly, up hip, up the side of her body, skidding against faux chainmail- she brought one arm as far left as it would go to offer a smooth plane for the hammer to slide along as it clipped shoulderblade- hard enough to make her right arm go numb, her thoughts momentarily dashed out of her head.</p>
<p>Hammer moved on, arcing to head for Doglick again- she fell, now backflipping through the air by the momentum just from those grazing hits.</p>
<p>The plan.  Glamour-</p>
<p>No, she&#8217;d used the glamour.</p>
<p>She fell.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d had a plan and she couldn&#8217;t organize her thoughts enough to remember it, and she had seconds.</p>
<p>A fragment of a remembered conversation with Verona-</p>
<p><em>Bearer of fang and smoke</em>.</p>
<p>She had her own title.</p>
<p>Smoke was a safe bet.  She had a whole pocket full, that she didn&#8217;t need to sort out.</p>
<p>She threw them all.</p>
<p>A cloud of smoke that she fell straight into- with light shining through it, to help with connecting to High Summer.  A few careful movements-</p>
<p>She became smoke, part of that explosion.</p>
<p>She became big.  Part of the explosion of smoke, some of it, and none of it.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;d stopped falling.</p>
<p>She saw America preparing something.  Putting some green rock close to paper- paper with runes on it.</p>
<p>Elemental runes.</p>
<p>Lucy maneuvered, gathering herself, moving, and finding her body and her senses again.</p>
<p>At least this was a medium she was comfortable in, with a stock of glamour.</p>
<p>She could speak.  It helped that she had the earring.  For that connection to sound and communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;America Tedd.  You shattered the innocence of my mother and my friend&#8217;s parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did most of it,&#8221; America called up.</p>
<p>America unleashed the spell card.  Wind, to dissipate the smoke in a violent way.</p>
<p>But Lucy was already breaking the glamour.  Ready to drop the twenty or so feet down to America Tedd.  Already with a sign prepared on one hand.</p>
<p><em>Arena</em>. <em>You and me.  One on one</em>.</p>
<p>She created the sphere of the Arena while still airborne.  Colors changed.  Swords plunged down faster than Lucy could.</p>
<p><em>My battlefield</em>.</p>
<p>She landed hard, hair billowing out, many times its usual size, pink.  It being her arena made the landing easier.</p>
<p>&#8220;With ninety nine fucks given and taken from ninety-nine goblins of note, I say <em>fuck that!</em>&#8221; America shouted.</p>
<p>Shattering the Arena.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fucking know how you fight, I&#8217;m prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy slipped on the weapon ring, and pulled her cloak out.</p>
<p>Turning it into a cloak with knives at the edges, the &#8216;fabric&#8217; an arrangement of metal slats linked together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit of fear she&#8217;s felt, you owe threefold!  You broke that innocence!&#8221; Lucy shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to <em>curse</em> me?  Using Karmic law?&#8221; America asked, laughing.  &#8220;You shot for the moon and you left them vulnerable while you did it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s cape of knives raked America&#8217;s forearms as America reached to her mouth.  Lucy scrambled out of the way, in case it was some acid vomit or something.</p>
<p>But America was pulling out a staff.  Lucy turned, hard, and the cape unfurled, extending, and the knives cut the back of America&#8217;s legs.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t matter.  Like Liberty, she had protection against minor inconveniences like half-inch cuts in the back of her calves. and knees.</p>
<p>The staff was shedding what looked like spores or pollen.</p>
<p><em>My mom&#8217;s watching.  I can&#8217;t fuck this up</em>.</p>
<p><em>I told Verona I could do this, and I feel like I really need her trust</em>.</p>
<p>Lucy pulled out spell cards, clumsily, with one of her arms still flooded with pins and needles from her brief contact with the hammer in the sky.</p>
<p>And one of America&#8217;s goblins jumped out of nowhere, grabbing them out of Lucy&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Another caught her cape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have help?  Remember?&#8221; America asked.  Her grin was impossibly wide- some more goblin magic primed.  And her eyes were still lifeless.  &#8220;Big help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays lunged out of the shadows.</p>
<p>Without the name thing to forge connections and give him a special permission to punish, he was just a thousand pounds of bulk, muscle, spikes, and raw power.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>Lucy had a bit of training with Guilherme, and a significant share had been training against those bigger than her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say my name!&#8221; he bellowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaygarrrrrr Who Sl-&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>The spores.</p>
<p>Her finger traced a line from earring to mouth.  <em>Let me be heard</em>.  &#8220;-avishly Slays!&#8221;</p>
<p>She dodged his follow-up.  He punched into the ground hard enough to kick up another plume of gravel, dry dirt, and damp dirt from a lower layer.</p>
<p>Damp dirt.  She stuck her foot out, sweeping it around- partially for balance, to pivot.  Partially to let that watch catch the damp.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t perfect, but it did <em>something.</em></p>
<p>She glimpsed America, thrusting the spiky end of the crooked wooden staff toward her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got-&#8221; America&#8217;s voice was slightly distorted. &#8220;-you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy ducked past it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a miss, actually,&#8221; she told America.  &#8220;And you wronged my family, you broke innocence, against the ideas of the Seal of Solomon-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the fuck over it.  And I&#8217;ve got you in the broader sense, so don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a gainsay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only not a gainsay if you-&#8221;</p>
<p>America had reared her head back.  Lucy ducked low, avoiding the spray of goblin vomit- tiny goblins among the chunks of the green geyser.  &#8220;-win.  Miss again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clapped her hands together.</p>
<p>Forming another arena.  Just in time, as Slaygar came crashing through the geyser.  He stopped short at the barrier.  Lucy hurried, ducking low, hand on the ground, fingers in dirt- a crude expression of a symbol-</p>
<p>&#8220;Say-&#8221;</p>
<p>-that twisted into a rune for sound.  She drew a hard line, fingers scraping through gravel.</p>
<p>Muting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not part of this.  This is me and America,&#8221; she said, turning.</p>
<p>He punched the side of the Arena.</p>
<p>And the barrier actually cracked.</p>
<p>She hadn&#8217;t expected that.</p>
<p>A second punch put a hole in it that he could reach through.  Cracks spread further.</p>
<p>America laughed.  She was holding Lucy&#8217;s spell cards.</p>
<p>She whipped them at Lucy.</p>
<p>Lucy reached for her cloak, weapon ring working, and turned it into a fan.  Blowing wind at the cards.  <em>Her</em> cards.  Maybe that counted for a little.  Runes drawn on her shoulder got hot, and provided more resistance, to count for a little more.  None hit her.</p>
<p>They exploded against the edges of the arena.  Water, fire, smoke-</p>
<p>&#8220;And Miss,&#8221; Lucy said, banishing the Arena by opening her hand with the arena mark on it.  &#8220;Three times-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three times you&#8217;ve said my name,&#8221; Miss answered.   &#8220;I said I&#8217;d answer when you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>America turned, and saw Miss standing behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Karmic jurisprudence and all that shit,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Break innocence, there&#8217;s a consequence.  Here you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bullshit,&#8221; America said.</p>
<p>But the wind picked up.  Miss reached out, adjusting in perspective and scale- hair and sleeve sweeping past America.</p>
<p>America fought back- tearing at the hair and sleeve- keeping from being completely covered by either.</p>
<p>And Lucy kicked her in the butt, knocking her off balance.</p>
<p>America plummeted all the way to Kennet found, helped by Miss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arena&#8217;s my turf, but so is Kennet,&#8221; Lucy said, to the space where America had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Slaygarrrr Who Slavishly Slays bellowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t protect her, Slaygarrrrr Who Slavishly Slays.  Let the binding be undone, go where you came from,&#8221; Lucy told him.</p>
<p>He huffed out an annoyed sound, then stepped back.</p>
<p>The shadows that passed over him were exaggerated, the desaturation from being in the dark affected the colorful, mostly bloody parts of him more than they should have, and he became a blur in the dark, then became nothing.  Gone.</p>
<p>Leaving Lucy in the middle of a bunch of hostile practitioners, still.</p>
<p><em>Might need an escape route, Miss</em>, she thought, eyeing her surroundings.</p>
<p>Nobody seized on the moment to attack her.</p>
<p>Because Anthem Tedd was standing by his car, and his presence alone was almost more of a thing than Lucy kicking America&#8217;s ass and dealing with the big goblin in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you done?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big penalty on the books for aggravated harm to Kennet and its innocents,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;She&#8217;ll be in Kennet found for a long while.  Karmically secured too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Anthem said.  &#8220;She can send for me when she&#8217;s out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy paced to one side, keeping the surrounding practitioners in view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re going about this the wrong way.  A lot of these people will listen to you, and I know you&#8217;ll listen to me.  America&#8217;s not wrong that everything&#8217;s screwed up.  Let&#8217;s at least sit down with people outside of our bubble, talk.  Work out solutions.  I&#8217;ll call in favors, I&#8217;ll do the war mage tutoring you wanted.  I think you could even negotiate to get America out, if you really need her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled out his phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy walked over to her group.  Nobody stopped her.  It wasn&#8217;t like they were giving her any special respect, but they weren&#8217;t disrespecting her either.  She breathed hard, knee hurting, shoulder hurting.  She rolled it experimentally, and felt a sharp pang that interrupted her breathing, along with a weird <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>If she had to have her arm in another fucking sling again&#8230;</p>
<p>The silence from Anthem persisted for the entirety of that.  His eyes on his phone.  Nobody from the practitioner group spoke up.</p>
<p>Lucy couldn&#8217;t really stop breathing hard, and it burned a bit in her throat.  She wondered if the spores from the staff had any lingering side effects.  Goblin stuff often did.  Infections.  Weird illnesses.</p>
<p><em>Have to see Tashlit</em>, get cleared up.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you come around,&#8221; Anthem said, &#8220;go straight to any of the main houses.  I&#8217;ll let the staff know to receive you, and each of them will have instructions for you.  Drudge work, for a little while, until you make up for the inconveniences you&#8217;ve caused.  Three months, six months.  We&#8217;ll see how you do.  It&#8217;s hard to travel, situation being what it is, but I trust you&#8217;ll find a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And until you come around, you aren&#8217;t allowed onto the properties, I&#8217;ll tell the staff to adjust the wards.  No access to the bank account, I&#8217;ve just shut it off.  Same with the phone.  Don&#8217;t call in favors or assume anything of Tedd family allies.  I won&#8217;t broadcast your lapses to those people, to avoid the embarrassment and distraction in hard times, but if you do try to use the Tedd family name with them, there will be consequences down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t.  Daddy- talk to me!  Have a conversation!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you a lot, Liberty.  I sacrificed a lot, I put a lot of stock into you.  I went out of my way to hand you opportunities.  I&#8217;m not going to say you owe me something for that.  But if you&#8217;re going to take things in this direction&#8230; I&#8217;ll stop giving, I&#8217;ll stop sacrificing, I&#8217;ll stop putting stock in you.  I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221; he paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do this,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>Lucy swallowed past a lump in her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish for anything bad to happen to you.  I love you still.  I&#8217;m just-&#8221; he paused.  &#8220;-painfully disappointed.  Please come around.  Then come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy caught Liberty as she dropped to her knees, head bowed, keeping it from being too rough a drop onto rocky ground.  Even if Liberty didn&#8217;t feel the small hurts, she didn&#8217;t deserve skinned knees on top of- of <em>this.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re disappointed!?&#8221; Lucy shouted.  &#8220;She&#8217;s old enough to have a voice!  Let her speak!  Have that fucking conversation she&#8217;s asking for!  Or aren&#8217;t you man enough!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty reached up and scraped fingers against Lucy&#8217;s chainmail sweater.  Her hand trailed down until she had a grip on the end of the sleeve, pulling down on it.</p>
<p>Like a silent &#8216;stop&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn?  Martin?&#8221; Anthem asked.  &#8220;I was going to take you two and my two daughters out, but my daughters won&#8217;t be coming.  Two more can come.  Who knows their way around magical items?  We might get gainsaid along the way.  Raise your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hands were raised.</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom had ventured closer.  Lucy motioned for her to stay back, while she was still huddled down beside Liberty, arms braced around her, as if to keep her from falling further toward the ground.  Various goblins milled around, trying to reach for Liberty, to pat her leg, or hug her.  Some hugged at Lucy, as if to support her so she could support Liberty.</p>
<p>Lucy looked up and saw Grandfather and Rook.</p>
<p>&#8220;She came to help us manage a tough situation.  She doesn&#8217;t deserve for this to happen because she helped us,&#8221; Lucy told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do except make accommodations and support her,&#8221; Rook said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man like that won&#8217;t bend.  You&#8217;ll break yourself against his inflexibility if you try to make him bow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an ass,&#8221; Grandfather added.</p>
<p>Anthem found the people he wanted to come with him.  Practitioners kept a wary eye on Lucy&#8217;s group as they gathered around the side of the car, talking in low voices to Anthem.  The voices blurred in together.  Lucy could have listened for a proper update on where that group was at, but&#8230; that really wasn&#8217;t what was important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone tell me it&#8217;s okay for me to do something about this,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>The answer was a croak of a voice.  With her arms around Liberty, steadying the girl, Lucy felt the flinch that came from that particular voice.  As if it was an insult added to injury.  &#8220;Can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s eyes wandered.  Liberty was barely moving, except to cry silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my dear,&#8221; Toadswallow said, as he approached.  &#8220;I never wanted you to know he was capable of this cruelty.  It&#8217;s why I left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty didn&#8217;t react.  Toadswallow came up to the other side of her, and put a hand at her back, another hand at her leg.  &#8220;Bubbleyum&#8217;s around.  You haven&#8217;t seen her since you were very small.  Come stay with us.  Come.  Up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He coaxed her.  Every word became an individual instruction that Liberty mechanically followed.</p>
<p>Liberty had talked about feeling some of America&#8217;s emotion, a gut feeling that was only part of what America was feeling.</p>
<p>And Lucy now felt some of what Liberty was feeling.  It hurt enough to choke her.  More than her shoulder or knee hurt, and her knee hurt a ton, from being crouched down after banging it like she had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone please tell me I can do something about this,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.  &#8220;And that the council won&#8217;t get mad at me, or that people won&#8217;t try to stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can,&#8221; Toadswallow croaked, as he led Liberty toward a side street.  &#8220;If you can&#8217;t, that&#8217;s fine too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It hurt too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy, you really shouldn&#8217;t-&#8221; her mom started.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d stopped when Lucy turned to face her.  Sight on, eyes red, but they would&#8217;ve been red anyways, from hurt.  Tears in her eyes and on her cheeks.  Tension, anger, hurt of her own, that went back years and years.</p>
<p>High Summer glamour to become light.  The inconsistent streetlights-  It took a second to draw the lines.  Anthem was already driving away, his car full of practitioners.</p>
<p>Lucy became the light, flickering and patchy in Kennet below in the early evening.  Here and there she became Lucy again, running, that light glinting off of her.</p>
<p>Her anklet clicked as Anthem saw her in his rear view mirror.</p>
<p>Then she darted forward again.  Over, up- light from a broken streetlight shone red on the top of a light post.  She twisted the glamour still on her hands, tinting it red, becoming red light, became Lucy, and leaped for the roof of the car.</p>
<p>A ward flared into existence- set a while ago, hidden, and she was pushed away as if by magnetic force, invisible but intense, stronger as she got closer.  She hit the road, rolling.</p>
<p>Huffing for breath, <em>mad</em> now, she fixed the glamour, then gave chase again.  Down the street, past the car this time- passing in front of it.</p>
<p>The car itself was warded, but she plunged her spear into the pavement.  Made the shaft spiked like the goblin&#8217;s had been, and maintained contact until the very last second, when she spun aside.</p>
<p>The wheel was warded too, protecting it against punctures.  But the car rode up the shaft.</p>
<p>Enough that the car veered a few feet right before it could be corrected.  Anthem, behind the wheel, braked hard.</p>
<p>The impact with the telephone pole, by and large, was light, and every ward on the car flared in reaction.  Every window and panel had a protection.  It came to a stop, headlight smashed, bit of a crumple at the one corner.</p>
<p>The driver&#8217;s side door opened.  Anthem got out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <em>really</em> want to do this?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She pulled a pen out of her pocket and turned it into a blade.  She scratched a triangle onto the telephone pole, and underlined it.</p>
<p>It ignited.  Right near the front corner of the car.</p>
<p>Anthem let her.  He stood by and watched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your daughter is crying.  Turn back, go back, apologize.  Beg for her forgiveness and then earn it, however many years it takes.  Be a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you want to do this.  Alright.&#8221;</p>

<p>Verona, wary, leaned over as far as she could get to be near Lucy, and murmured, &#8220;You know&#8230; in the movies and TV shows, when someone&#8217;s all, &#8216;I&#8217;ll hold the line, I&#8217;ll say and fight, it&#8217;s my responsibility, you do what you have to&#8217;&#8230; it&#8217;s not like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; Lucy grunted, elbow on her desk, heel of her hand at her chin, fingers curled around her mouth.  Her pen took the periodic note.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morehouse lectured, &#8220;Aung San Suu Kyi and then the <em>exclusionary</em> globalization after Nargis devastated the Irrawaddy Delta&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the everfucking what?&#8221; Verona whispered to Lucy.  &#8220;What language is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shhh,&#8221; Lucy whispered.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll compare notes after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After each of those four readings you&#8217;ll need to compare and contrast.  First contact with the First Nations here in Canada, technology and opportunity in so-called &#8216;third world&#8217; countries, the legacies of imperialism in India, and Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the <em>fuuuuck</em>?&#8221; Verona mouthed the words, mostly to herself now, eyes wide.  She leaned over to Lucy, whispering, &#8220;this sounds more like the gobbledegook I expected from the BHI classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shhh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aim for about four paragraphs, one for each article, one and a half pages, roughly.  You&#8217;ll draw out the highlights, distinctions, and draw a line of commonalities and chronologies between the four articles.  It doesn&#8217;t need to be a polished essay like we did the other week, but it shouldn&#8217;t be point form either.  What you do need to do is show a full and complete understanding of the subjects- each of the articles, how they tie together, and how they don&#8217;t.  We&#8217;re going to have the exact same structure as a quarter of your mark in the end of semester exam, but with four shorter readings, so nail it down now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona wanted to drag her fingernails down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Right now, there was cool, important, interesting stuff happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m laying it all out for you guys, lots of advance warning,&#8221; the teacher explained.  &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you what the homework will be now, and as we go through class you can listen out for keywords you&#8217;ll need for the assignment, and the homework assignment is early prep for what the exam will ask of you, so pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeremy had his phone in his lap, and it glowed briefly as he turned it on and typed something.</p>
<p>Caroline pulled her own phone out of her pocket, then looked over her shoulder at Jeremy to flash him a smile.</p>
<p><em>Gag me.</em></p>
<p>It sucked.  Feeling unwanted.  As a friend.  As a girl.</p>
<p>Like, she knew it didn&#8217;t make <em>total</em> sense and Jeremy had his reasons and he wanted to buy into this big bullshit idea about romance and relationships and everything but also like&#8230; she liked her body and it felt like that was a whole other unhealthy, bullshit script she&#8217;d managed to dodge that everyone else treated as universal, she knew she wasn&#8217;t a <em>ten out of ten</em> or anything but whatever?  She could look herself in the mirror and fire off finger guns and she liked her clothes and she liked her hair.  Cool.</p>
<p>This one jerkass who she&#8217;d shared nearly everything with had turned around and said &#8216;not good enough&#8217; and now it didn&#8217;t feel very fucking cool at all.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;d been Easton, and she didn&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t care about anything Easton had to say, and he&#8217;d made a shitty comment in response to her joke about no nude figure drawings, and somehow <em>that</em> kept niggling at her.  Fine in the one moment, but given a bit more time, somehow <em>that</em> cut deep?  What the fuck?</p>
<p>Which just made her feel like absolute shit, sitting at the back of class.  Sitting through every minute felt like she had a toothpick wedged between toe and toenail and she was repeatedly kicking the back of the seat in front of her.  <em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>She wanted to say something to Lucy.  Maybe there was some sympathy or understanding there, after Lucy had gotten punked by the stupid app last spring, by the stupid, <em>stupid</em> boys who&#8217;d rated them all and put Lucy at the bottom.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t sure how to bring that up, and Lucy was focusing on class.  Mostly.</p>
<p>And before Verona could craft her comment or whatever, <em>Wallace</em> got a message from Jeremy.    He reached back, hand against the front edge of Lucy&#8217;s desk, watching Mrs. Morehouse.</p>
<p>When the teacher turned around to write on the whiteboard &#8211; <em>Social globalization.  Sociological globalization.  What&#8217;s the difference?  </em>Wallace lifted his ass out of his seat and craned his body over Lucy&#8217;s desk, while she pulled her butt out of her seat and learned forward, so Wallace could whisper something in her ear.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Lucy flashed a smile and then whispered something back.  The two of them sat down quickly before Mrs. Morehouse could turn around, looking a bit goofy.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick</em>.</p>
<p>Getting that metaphorical toothpick under her toenail in a millimeter deeper with every metaphorical kick.</p>
<p>Verona practically squirmed in her seat, she wanted to be gone so bad.  Doing something or <em>anything</em> else.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between financial and economic globalization?&#8221; Mrs. Morehouse asked.  &#8220;Anyone?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hands went up.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick.  </em>Metaphorical toothpicks under a metaphorical toenail, as she metaphorically kicked the chair in front of her over and over again.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d finished two huge-ass rituals in the last few days.  She&#8217;d created a Demesne, a magic house.  Was she in her magic house right now?  Fucking no she wasn&#8217;t.  She&#8217;d founded a new Kennet with a huge-ass ritual that had caught major practitioners from the region and surrounding areas with their pants down.  She&#8217;d met some of the Others and it sounded like a great place.  Cool.  Was she there?  Fuck no she fucking wasn&#8217;t.  She was at fucking school, which was the opposite of a magic house and the opposite of Kennet found.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>School had been a chore before but when had it become something she viscerally <em>hated, </em>minute by minute?</p>
<p>Maybe it was the lack of outlets.  There were things she liked to do that let her chill out and there hadn&#8217;t been a lot of chill.  She&#8217;d barely slept when the invaders had come in over the weekend, she&#8217;d barely slept while getting the Founding off, and she&#8217;d cheated timewise with Demesne ritual.  The result was that she&#8217;d kind of slept four or five hours, stayed up all night, slept a bit in the day, then caught sixish hours, four or five hours, then twenty four hours awake that didn&#8217;t really count as being <em>awake</em> because she was outside of normal needs for sleep and outside the usual bounds of time.</p>
<p>Which was fine, she felt tired but not like she was dying or going to fall asleep in class.  But she hadn&#8217;t watched a TV show in the last while, she&#8217;d mostly goofed around with McCauleigh but even that was a bit of a balancing act, playing nice with a person who might be an enemy if the winds changed.</p>
<p>It was showers still being cold and food being whatever she managed to grab and chow down on here and there, it was a life without music or television, and a life without a boy to kiss.  It made all the negative things worse, and so school went from something she disliked into something almost unbearable.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>Even if she could, what would she do?  There was no boy after Jeremy, she wasn&#8217;t even sure what show she would watch if she could.  The last one she&#8217;d watched had been&#8230;</p>
<p>Holy shit had it only been last Thursday?  It felt like weeks and weeks ago.</p>
<p>The show had veered hard into a romance subplot and she hadn&#8217;t had the patience for it.  Not for the one thousandth time she&#8217;d seen that stuff play out when she didn&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the idea she was stuck like this like she was stuck at home and there were good and cool things in life.  It wasn&#8217;t just that there was no <em>outlet</em>, there was no out.  She was supposed to go from this to home and her dad and back to this and so on for the next three years and the magic stuff she cared about would forever be in the background.  It was the kind of stuff she could spend twenty-four hours a day on and still not get into everything she wanted to get into and yet&#8230; it felt more like if she allotted more than an hour a day for it, she fell behind.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t enough time for it all.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>It was five past ten.  They&#8217;d finished gym class twenty minutes ago, which hadn&#8217;t been fun at all when she did <em>not</em> want to be running around.  Social studies ran from nine forty-five until eleven thirty, when they got out for lunch.  She would get half an hour to get where she needed to be, eat, run around and make sense of what was going on in Kennet, touch base with others, and then get back.</p>
<p>Back by twelve.</p>
<p>Then Math until one forty-five, then her Art elective until three thirty.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d have to stop by the house to get stuff, after.  Her dad didn&#8217;t tend to work that long at the end of the week, so there was a good chance he&#8217;d be there.  Then more than an hour of practice stuff that would mean she&#8217;d fall behind.  Then she&#8217;d stare at the homework being assigned now, by Mrs. Morehouse, who wasn&#8217;t talking to Mr. Sitton or the art teacher about how much was being assigned, so they&#8217;d each give a night&#8217;s worth of homework.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>She&#8217;d squeeze in the homework and not do well enough and watch a show in the background and not enjoy that and then she&#8217;d endure her dad bitching and moaning and finding <em>some</em> way to waste her already insufficient time and then she&#8217;d sleep and do it all over again.</p>
<p><em>I am a nascent fucking sorceress of halflight and shadow who created a magic town and earned a magic house.  Why am I doing this?</em></p>
<p>The clock crawled forward.  Second by second.  <em>Tick tock tick tock.</em></p>
<p>There was now a metaphorical toothpick under every metaphorical toenail, of varying lengths and angles.  Each metaphorical kick against something hard moved an unpredictable number an unpredictable amount, some driven into metaphorical flesh, some scraping bone and twisting, some driven into and through toenails, splitting them.  Her leg wouldn&#8217;t sit still, jittering, and she tried to distract herself, mixing taking notes on what sounded important enough to figure out later with doodles in the margins to save her sanity and graphic visualizations of toothpicks and toenails to try to take what she was feeling and frame it.</p>
<p>Kennet was under attack.  Everything she was doing was under attack.  She was here for Jasmine, enduring this for Jasmine, and for Avery and for Lucy.  Because if she skipped school again she&#8217;d pretty much have skipped every class this week.  If she skipped every class this week and there was trouble because of it, then the parents would freak out.</p>
<p>Jeremy glanced at Caroline.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Financial integration refers to a country&#8217;s linkages to international capital markets.  Fair, understandable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Various heads around the class nodded.</p>
<p>Verona&#8217;s leg jittered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Mrs. Morehouse declared.</p>
<p>The world was changing, Liberty was trying to help them out while they&#8217;d been total assholes by fucking off to go to school, on parents&#8217; orders.  Charles was putting plans into action, people were fighting for Lordships, and Musser&#8217;s return to Kennet was something Verona needed to prepare for.</p>
<p>Eight minutes past ten.</p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock.</em></p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock.</em></p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you attacking me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona approached, arms extended.  &#8220;Sorta.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCauleigh dropped into a fighting stance.  She had a natural &#8216;jeans commercial&#8217; look, jeans, simple white tank top, fit, hair not too tidy, just mussed up enough to look natural.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hug?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why a hug?&#8221; McCauleigh asked, wary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I need a fucking hug, why else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask your friend Lucy.  Isn&#8217;t she your best friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My best friend Lucy is catching up with her boyfriend, maybe they&#8217;re hugging, I dunno.  My other best friend is probably getting ready to go to school in Thunder Bay, three freaking hours away, getting a hug out of her girlfriend.  My <em>other</em> best friend may have demoted herself to just &#8216;friend&#8217; and is busy trying to help keep the peace elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re aware you sound like a fifth grader, all &#8216;my fifteen hundred best friends&#8217; or whatever, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off.  They&#8217;re important to me and &#8216;friend&#8217; isn&#8217;t a good enough word.  Now, you, me, we did the whole sleepover bonding bullshit, talking about shitty parents and rude boy stuff, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; McCauleigh asked, unsure.  &#8220;Was fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you all that shit about it being hard to open up and share emotions and all that crap.  Now I need a damn hug and if you&#8217;re a friend it would sure be appreciated if you&#8217;d give me one and if you won&#8217;t make too fucking big a deal of it, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you sound more reluctant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>But McCauleigh approached and gave Verona a stiff hug.  McCauleigh wasn&#8217;t wearing a jacket and her arms were bare, skin cold at the back of Verona&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really bad at this,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off.  I can&#8217;t really remember the last time I hugged someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, I hugged people I was fighting, for judo or whatever I was training in, but that doesn&#8217;t count, does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really.  Well, glad if I broke your hug-ginity.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCauleigh ended the hug.  &#8220;You just made it weird.  And it wasn&#8217;t my hug-ginity.  I&#8217;ve been hugged.  But I was probably closer to three or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Well, thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You good now?  I&#8217;d offer- offer something, but I have no idea how to-&#8221; McCauleigh fumbled.  &#8220;Cookies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cookies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fucking know what people do to make other people feel better.  I figured baking&#8217;s nice sometimes, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were going to make me fresh cookies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fucking know.  Can we change the subject away from the damn cookies?  You good?  Want another hug?  If you want a better one you&#8217;re going to have to tell me what to fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good, but if you&#8217;ll allow me to briefly return to the subject of cookies&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, do you want to be enemies again?  We can throw this friendship away over your fixation on fucking cookies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super nice and cool that you thought of something like that, okay?  It&#8217;s cool,&#8221; Verona told McCauleigh.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t get defensive-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to stab you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or offensive.  It&#8217;s cool.  Okay?  I super appreciate you thinking along those lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you need the hug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just going to say, if you&#8217;re ever undercover, whatever, trying to blend in, asking &#8216;do you want to talk about it&#8217; like you just did is much better and more natural than cookies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I like the example you gave.  If I gotta fake it, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, yeah.  And uh&#8230; school sucks.  Home sucks.  Going between home and school when I&#8217;ve got better shit to do <em>really</em> sucks.  I wanted to crawl out of my skin for a bit there and I want to make it clear, I&#8217;m <em>sure</em> I could literally pull off a practice that lets me crawl out of my literal skin.  So I&#8217;m having to sit there and <em>not</em> do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn straight.  I get that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It just all kinda really sucks,&#8221; Verona said, gesticulating wildly with one hand, &#8220;And I gotta go back in like twenty minutes and <em>that</em> sucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Super sucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why,&#8221; Verona gesticulated even more dramatically, before indicating McCauleigh, &#8220;are you here, at my Demesne, while I wallow in the suck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving you intel and lounging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awesome.  Can you intel me while I get food and then you can lounge more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you get me food too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  About as easy to make it for two as it is for one.  Get a blanket over you or something in the meantime?  You felt cold when you hugged me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went inside.  Peckersnot was standing on the front steps of the House on Half Street, arms upstretched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offering me a hug, little man?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Not super satisfying with the size difference, but I appreciate the idea of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted him to one shoulder and he hugged the side of her neck, before slumping down to lie sideways across her shoulder, holding on.</p>
<p>Inside, she dropped off her bag and went to her kitchen, pulling out some bread and butter to slather the bread with butter while her hotplate warmed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is awfully close to the alchemy setup you&#8217;ve got there,&#8221; McCauleigh said, as she walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the hot plate is part of my alchemy setup, you ding dong.  I don&#8217;t have a working stove or kitchen yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cook and do alchemy in the same space?&#8221; McCauleigh asked, as she returned, blanket in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s concerning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it concerning enough for you to not want me to cook you a grilled cheese sandwich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  I&#8217;m just observing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I have two grilled cheese sandwiches?&#8221; McCauleigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to make one and now we&#8217;ve reached a point where I&#8217;m debating making three?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I burn a lot of calories when I blood rage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; one end piece of bread.  I could cut it in half, use half for the top, one for the bottom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just depressing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; McCauleigh asked.  She&#8217;d pulled the blanket over her and the top part made a hood over her head.  &#8220;Endpiece.  You might as well slap me in the face, Hayward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, second option, since I don&#8217;t eat much, because I&#8217;m petite and lazy, you take half my sandwich, for one and a half sandwiches total, plus some pepperoni sticks, pickles, salty chips, and other stuff to round things out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deal, she says,&#8221; Verona said out loud, as she threw the toast on.  &#8220;Deal, like we&#8217;re negotiating or something.  What am I getting here, besides the hug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Intel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Intel.  Right.  Run it by me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America wants to sway the goblins.  Restore morale, they&#8217;re- there&#8217;s a whole thing going on, they&#8217;re really torn about the Tedd sisters not being together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she&#8217;s going to pull something big.  Big goblin, specifically.  Later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  That really helps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be coordination.  An initial attack to draw some of your guys away from where the big goblin will be making a move.  Hadley was looking for me, she wanted to make me part of that force.  I&#8217;ll just skip that though.  Say I was keeping an eye on your Demesne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t get you in trouble or hurt things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck it.  I&#8217;m in trouble anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Verona said.  She flipped the bread and laid the cheddar cheese on top.  While the butter sizzled, she got out the pepperoni sticks and pickles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm, protein.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?  Long term?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No idea.  See the way this all goes.  Who wins, if Musser gets out ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded like you knew for sure you didn&#8217;t want to be some Hennigar chump, doing the blood rage death scream thing and getting your ass kicked a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; McCauleigh replied, taking the pepperoni stick she was holding and poking it in Verona&#8217;s direction.  Peckersnot nearly fell off Verona&#8217;s shoulder as he craned his head out, biting for the pepperoni.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not <em>chumps.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys can be a little&#8230; chumpy, kinda, you know?&#8221;  Verona tore off a bit of pepperoni and gave it to Peckersnot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate my family, Hayward.  You <em>do</em> realize how we operate, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I just say?  Blood rage death scream, calling out to War herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&#8230; it keeps you from dying when you&#8217;d get shot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  To stay in the fight.  To stay up when others would fall.  What do you think the casualty rate is like for the Songetays?  Or the Cavendars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230; moderate to high?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderate to high.  What do you think the casualty rate is like for my brothers and sisters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From your line of questioning, I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s&#8230; low?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Low to <em>none</em>.  The <em>Driscolls</em> lost two family members to rivals a couple years back, kid and his mom, which means they&#8217;ve lost more people in the last three years than we&#8217;ve had in the last ten, and the Driscolls are city mages and historians, a family about books, not blades.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Garricks, who you had picking up people?  They&#8217;ve had more.  We survive, we fight, we have more kids, we have kids that make it to adulthood, our adults live longer, nice little side benefit of giving Death the big middle finger.  Which means we get to have a nice big family with numbers that get closer to the big non-combat practitioner families.  <em>And</em> we hold the privileged status of They Who Should Not Be Fucked With.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could almost hear the capital letters on those words but that might be imagination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Anyway, why do you think we had five students at the Blue Heron?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five?  Weren&#8217;t there four?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t there in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were five in the spring.  Shut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay well, sure, I&#8217;ll maybe concede that, but just to point out, we&#8217;ve fucked with the Hennigars <em>some.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve fucked with the Hennigars some politically.  A bit?  I could make the argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Sandwich.  There&#8217;s some ketchup packets here if you want ketchup with your grilled cheese.  This brand&#8217;s too sweet for me, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; McCauleigh said, going to some effort to take the little plate with the sandwich while keeping shrouded in the blanket.  She helped herself to pickles and pepperoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta admit, your brothers and maybe your sister are a bit chump-y.  Being able to keep fighting after you&#8217;re shot is cool and all, but if you&#8217;re getting shot a lot and stuff, even if you have a way of sort of dealing with it, you&#8217;re still getting shot a lot, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we just agree my brothers might be chumps and compromise there?  Before we fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; Verona said, brightly.  &#8220;Um, intel.  Was there more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it for now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peckersnot, hey, I&#8217;ll bribe you with food if you&#8217;ll run this message?  Get it to Liberty, she might know what the big goblin America is calling on might be.  And then tell Louise, Miss, or Toadswallow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peckersnot peeped.</p>
<p>Verona penned it down then handed him the paper, lowering him to the ground before taking a morsel of pepperoni and giving it to him.  It was too big for his beaked mouth, so he just held it there with one hand as he disappeared into a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Like, if we win, if we work with Liberty tonight and drive off America, or get her to concede, or <em>something</em>, you going to go back home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; McCauleigh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I did have a thought.  It&#8217;s not a permanent solution, if you need a break or need an escape, you could get yourself trapped in Kennet found.  For repeat offenders, there&#8217;s a civility course.  Means you&#8217;d stay for three days.  Or seven.  Or, maybe I talk to Miss and we make it fourteen, no course, just a time out, and you sell it to your family as it being about you doing something really heinous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heinous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just an option, anyway.  A two week break from everything?  It&#8217;d be nice to have you around, I want to stay friends but I&#8217;m pretty bad at staying in touch with people online like Avery is.  I could make you up a room for a longer stay.  You could stay in this house when you want and still technically be in Kennet found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure any more than two weeks, they might send a rescue party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw my nightmare.  They don&#8217;t care all that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  My dad either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ate for a short bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to be out there, but the parents were all, &#8216;you need to stay safe, go to school, keep to a routine&#8217;, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  At least someone cares, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shrugged.  &#8220;School sucks, this situation sucks, home sucks&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck yes.  Family sucks.  Expectations suck.  People suck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys who bone you and then ditch you suck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take your word for it.  Boys can suck it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona thought about bringing up Easton&#8217;s comment at the table, that had happened just a few feet away, but kept mum.  It&#8217;d be shitty to broadcast that, even if Easton thoroughly deserved getting shit on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this suckfest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mallory from Kennet below.  She was wearing a frankenjacket with stitches and patches, and a roughly attached fuzzy collar that helped hide most of the neck tats.</p>
<p>She was followed by Melissa and Bracken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Problem?  Tell me there&#8217;s a valid excuse to me missing school this afternoon,&#8221; Verona told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, no.  Just doing a walk around, trying to exercise my stupid foot,&#8221; Melissa said.  &#8220;You&#8217;re on the route we&#8217;re walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn.  Nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet.  People are sleeping, we think.  I second Mal&#8217;s question.  What sucks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of stuff sucks,&#8221; Verona answered.  &#8220;We are <em>commiserating</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of word that makes me want to hit you,&#8221; Mallory replied.  &#8220;What&#8217;s it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sure!&#8221; Verona admitted.  &#8220;But I&#8217;ve read it in books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still making me want to hit you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Means, like, group whining?&#8221; Melissa asked, she was hanging back some, hands in her pockets.  Her face was a bit red from the colder weather and the walk over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck no it&#8217;s not group whining,&#8221; McCauleigh retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s angry at the world whining,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Angry at how much things suck sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you there,&#8221; Melissa said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have food?&#8221; Mallory asked, nose upturned, sniffing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make your own grilled cheese out of a single end piece if you want.  There&#8217;s pepperoni and pickles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mal- Mel.  we have too many fucking names that start with M in this room,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Melissa, you&#8217;re Oakham as long as you&#8217;re around these guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the fuck am <em>I</em> the one who gets demoted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t remember Mallory&#8217;s last name and McCauleigh is taking a break from family shit, and you were on sports teams so you went by Oakham a lot, on the back of your jersey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sports?&#8221; McCauleigh asked.</p>
<p>Oakham answered, &#8220;Gymnastics, dance, soccer, hockey, mostly.  Occasionally other stuff.  Then Nicolette fucking Belanger&#8217;s stupid ghost thing snapped off my foot while I was in the middle of a flying routine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221; McCauleigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to have a suckfest party?  That sucked <em>ass.  </em>It went to town, sucking on that ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want food, Oakham?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Mallory looks like she&#8217;s burning the last of the bread-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice the temperature, half the cooking time,&#8221; Mallory said.</p>
<p>&#8220;-but there&#8217;s pickles and dry pepperoni sticks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ate.  I&#8217;m trying to be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bracken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Going to check on Bag.  Can I use your bathroom and then get some water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  Thanks for asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he went upstairs, McCauleigh craned her head around to keep her eyes on him.  She looked at Oakham.  &#8220;Brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was my twin brother I&#8217;d be unable to sleep at night, knowing he was in the same house.  Incest sis Meliss, losing her mind as she pines away for the unobtainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck is with people in my Demesne making these weird-ass admissions about stuff?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of attraction that transcends brother sister relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one talking about that stuff right now!&#8221; Verona exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mal was laughing in the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I make some weird statement?&#8221; McCauleigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, you&#8217;re good.  Please don&#8217;t take that as an excuse to, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I don&#8217;t have any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured, but it&#8217;s happened three times now, and I&#8217;m wondering if I misconfigured something in my Demesne here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you looking,&#8221; Oakham told McCauleigh, taking on a surly tone.  &#8220;I like him.  I&#8217;m trying to get fit and physio the shit out of my ankle so I&#8217;m more someone he could like.  You want him, you want to take a shot?  Go through me, because I&#8217;m working my ass off here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d lose.  Even if I had my hands tied behind my back, and no practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d lose and I&#8217;d be so fucking shamefully awful and pitiable during and after the fight it&#8217;d ruin the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mal, who was burning the shit out of her grilled cheese, laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; McCauleigh replied.  She looked at Verona.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so weird when they can lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>They?</em>&#8221; Oakham asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just put her at ease, okay?  Don&#8217;t- don&#8217;t screw things up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.  But you said twin brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same age, month apart, even,&#8221; Oakham said, biting her lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn.  Thought he was seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oakham shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve met, right?&#8221; Verona asked, pointing between Oakham and McCauleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Briefly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been the longest fucking week.  McCauleigh is a dancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No shit.  Cool.  What kind?  Can you show me?&#8221; Oakham asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sword dance, gun dances, some- I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s like rhythmic gymnastics, but with empowered strength, murder, and screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.  Cool.  Maybe don&#8217;t show me, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bracken was coming back downstairs.  Both Oakham and McCauleigh turned their heads.  Verona rolled her eyes, but smiled a little.</p>
<p>Bracken held up his water bottle.  &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing special.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to check Bag isn&#8217;t being bullied on the playground.  I&#8217;ll see you later?  I&#8217;ll be doing shopping later for the refugees from the Family Man&#8217;s territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re still around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d offer to come with but I&#8217;d slow you down,&#8221; Oakham said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Bracken said.  &#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to the door, and Oakham followed, turning to mouth the words, <em>It&#8217;s fine, come</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;See ya.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oakham nodded.  &#8220;See you.  Good luck with the whole invasion magic bullshit stuff.  Let me know if I can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You help by not being in the worst of it and being alive, so you can be good blackguard,&#8221; Verona told Oakham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the three of Mal, Verona, and McCauleigh behind.  McCauleigh retrieved the blanket she&#8217;d shucked off when Bracken had turned off, wrapping herself in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you burn food that badly I&#8217;m pretty sure it becomes cancerous,&#8221; Verona observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t plan on living to old age anyway,&#8221; Mal replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed you weren&#8217;t that interested in the guy.  Bracken, was it?&#8221;  McCauleigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, and no I wasn&#8217;t.  Not my type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last guy I liked, Melissa Oakham just now, she liked him before, too.  Got pretty pissy over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona searched through her phone, then held out one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; McCauleigh said, in the tone of someone who wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sucks.  Decided to date a horse girl instead of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A horse girl?  Centaur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Someone who likes horses and that&#8217;s their thing.  Dresses a certain, I dunno, horse-riding way?  Preppy tight pants?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Raquel Musser?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy <em>I</em> like isn&#8217;t a centaur either,&#8221; Mal said, around a mouthful of food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful segue,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goes by Shirtless, and he&#8217;s shirtless, because he looks <em>so</em> good without a shirt.  That&#8217;s his thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me about him before,&#8221; McCauleigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll tell you again.  I got a picture of him this time, though, so you have context.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation went on for another minute before Verona&#8217;s phone went off.</p>
<p><em>Please be an excuse to skip class this afternoon.</em></p>
<p>It was just the alarm.</p>
<p>Lunch over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta go.  You guys- don&#8217;t burn down the building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See you,&#8221; Mcauleigh replied.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to.  Not sure it&#8217;s even possible, with a Demesne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mal might manage to if there&#8217;s a way.  Watch her for me.  Want me to turn up the heat so you can ditch the blanket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the heat exactly where it is so I can use the blanket,&#8221; McCauleigh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona got her stuff, rinsed her plate quickly to put it on the rack, and then headed to the door.</p>
<p>The conversation was ongoing, heated, fun, real.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t as lonely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;a quadratic equation we can write as y equals ax to the second power plus bx plus c, and we can do it this way, by writing y equals x to the second power minus two x minus eight using intercepts and symmetry, write that down, take a second.  There we go, still seeing pens and pencils moving, one or two left.  Okay, there we go.  Here we go, second approach would be sketching y equals three x to the second power minus twelve x plus one, completing the square and applying transformations, there.  Write that down, take a second, hold any questions, let&#8217;s just cover one more&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Sitton droned, filling every available second with more words.</p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock.</em></p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;graph h equals negative four point nine t to the second power plus fifty t plus one point five, and you can use your calculators for that one, there we go.  Write that down.  I see pencils still moving.  Good.  You&#8217;re going to have to get faster if you&#8217;re going to University.  They won&#8217;t be gracious enough to give you the time I&#8217;m giving you.  Now hopefully everyone is up to speed, because we&#8217;re going to get together into groups.  For this worksheet, work together, come to a single solution-&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p>Chairs scraped and desks banged.</p>
<p>&#8220;-in groups of four!  Single solution.  Talk, vet one another&#8217;s work, maybe each do the work on your own if you&#8217;re fast and then compare your results with your groupmates!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeremy paired up with Caroline.  Wallace automatically wanted to be with Jeremy.  Lucy wanted to be with Wallace and for one second things were fine for Lucy and then Lucy remembered, looking over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Lucy abandoned that group.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to group with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed classes too.  We&#8217;re both behind.  I&#8217;d be embarrassing myself in front of Wallace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just saying that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on.  Let&#8217;s find some people who know their shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good friend for not leaving her hanging, but it felt bad.  Verona&#8217;s hand twinged and for a second she almost hoped it would act up.  She rubbed at her palm and followed Lucy as Lucy went to Ian and Noah&#8217;s desks.  The pair were so caught up in talking that they weren&#8217;t really paying attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We missed a bunch of classes early this week, is that okay?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Can we follow your lead, try to catch up?  I know you&#8217;re good with math.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure,&#8221; Noah said.</p>
<p>Verona almost wanted to not have asked them, but it was too late, and the rationale was dumb.  What good would it have done?  Ian and Noah were dating, kind of, in a very &#8216;we&#8217;re the only gay guys in our grade, so why not?&#8217; kind of way.  Or maybe that was her being cynical.  And Verona didn&#8217;t really want to be sitting in a group with a <em>couple</em>.</p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick</em> <em>kick</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;First problem is on the board,&#8221; Mr. Sitton told the class.  &#8220;Next one to come.  Solve x to the second power plus ten x plus sixteen equals zero by factoring.  Then verify it algebraically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona rubbed hard at her palm, because her hand wanted to cramp up.  She watched over Lucy&#8217;s shoulder as Lucy wrote stuff down, instead of doing any writing herself.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t get much of any of this.</p>
<p>She was very aware of her own breathing, because she was breathing harder, feeling all of this.</p>
<p>She wondered about claiming her hand hurt, because it <em>did</em>, and then going to the bathroom to take a thirty minute break.</p>
<p>But what good would that do?  It would only get her as much negative attention as staying.  Lucy would worry more.</p>
<p>She stayed put, controlling her breathing, restless, wanting to be anywhere else.</p>
<p>Twelve fifteen.  An hour and thirty minutes left of math.  Then Art.  She liked art, but it would be ruined by being at the end of school, preceded by all of this, when she wanted nothing more than to be gone from this building.</p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock tick tock.</em></p>
<p><em>Kick kick kick kick.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Liberty smiled a shark smile, each tooth filed to be triangular.  They were moving as a group, trying to be somewhat stealthy, and that was really hard with the goblins being <em>super</em> excited Liberty was around.  Even nine hours after she&#8217;d turned up.</p>
<p>It was at the point where Verona worried even an innocent might clue in, because bushes moved and jostling goblins kept knocking over trash and store displays.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this constant?&#8221; Lucy asked, as a bush wriggled, five goblins inside it, trying to crab-bucket their way to a high enough point to reach out to Liberty as she passed.  She reached inside to rub a goblin&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.  It&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes!  It&#8217;s like having a bunch of ugly puppies super happy you got home, everywhere you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Lucy said, frowning.  &#8220;In a certain light.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed a group of kids from school.  Hailey and some older girl Verona didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Liberty flashed a smile, which seemed to startle Hailey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, uh&#8230;&#8221; Hailey said, before trailing off.  &#8220;About the arcade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The arcade we&#8217;re not supposed to talk about?&#8221; Verona asked, pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Any idea when something might be happening?  We were all talking earlier, during group work in Math, about maybe doing something on Halloween?  I&#8217;m not sure if you know who to talk to, but you seemed to know a lot and we thought it would be cool to have a big get-together there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Word on the street is there&#8217;s a bigger party planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hailey deflated.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can try asking,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know how intense it&#8217;ll be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty intense, apparently,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Like, not necessarily okay for everyone intense.  And people who maybe shouldn&#8217;t be around&#8230; classmates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the frig are they inviting that&#8217;s not supposed to be around us?&#8221; Hailey asked.  &#8220;Creeps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly, but we&#8217;ll ask,&#8221; Lucy repeated.  &#8220;Uh, but we really gotta go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy led Verona and Liberty away, and the moment they were out of earshot, Liberty exclaimed, &#8220;the <em>arcade!  </em>The goblins mentioned it, and Avery did.  But she hasn&#8217;t been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things have been hecked the fuck up,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, for sure.  I want to see this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have no idea what the future is going to be like,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re being attacked, right?  We don&#8217;t know if- I dunno.  Will Musser be in charge here?  Or one of the Carmine Exile&#8217;s monsters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeahhh,&#8221; Liberty drew out the word.  &#8220;I was wondering about that.  Apparently I got a bit of a pass?  The goblins were saying the Warrens are a mess.  Lots of fighting, things that are normally asleep are astir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think anyone who&#8217;s helping against Musser is getting overlooked, kinda.  Not help exactly, but you know?  They&#8217;re not being targeted,&#8221; Verona told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not <em>against</em> Musser, exactly,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Is that bad to say?  I&#8217;m mostly against the bullshit and confusion and other garbage that&#8217;s coming with all this.  If the Carmine Exile is dangerous and the Lordships are the only way to curb that power, then maybe we have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were, past tense,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Now he&#8217;s stronger than ever.  I don&#8217;t think there are <em>any</em> Musser Lordships that are really against Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, by the way,&#8221; Verona admitted, quiet.  &#8220;Felt like total shit leaving you and the Others to keep an eye on things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sorry.  I&#8217;m the one with the sister who&#8217;s being a fuckhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your dad is-&#8221; Verona started.  Lucy elbowed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t edit yourselves on my account.  I get it.  My dad isn&#8217;t working with the full picture, America&#8217;s generally pissed off about a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s been changing, losing the Blue Heron, Alexander was pretty cool to her, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s eyes dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not cool all the way through, though.  You know?&#8221;  Verona asked.  &#8220;Which is kind of an ongoing thing.  We&#8217;re seeing it with a lot of people.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Like your dad.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I get that my dad hasn&#8217;t been super in the right, he&#8217;s spooked you guys.  If he shows up, I&#8217;ll happily talk to him, try to square things away, okay?  He should listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can that would be super,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p><em>But he probably won&#8217;t listen and I&#8217;m seeing less and less reason to keep pretending it&#8217;s doable</em>, Verona thought.</p>
<p>She kept her mouth shut.</p>
<p>They reached a vantage point.  As they got out of sight of the street, goblins came out of the woodwork, filling every available bit of space.  Liberty naturally let her hand rest on one goblin&#8217;s head, while using the other hand to point.</p>
<p>Liberty reported, &#8220;They&#8217;re sticking mostly around the cabins in Kennet above and the town hall in Kennet below, they&#8217;re mostly clustered around there.  You can see the movements.  There&#8217;s a few points they can get between Above and Below.  Freeman is helping handle the Turtle Queen, but he&#8217;s starting to struggle, it&#8217;s getting harder, enough he can&#8217;t do anything except adjust the systems, and they don&#8217;t have a lot of other people who can deal with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we do something to mess with him?  Like shutting off the power to that block?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;No light, no power?  Maybe if we do it while it&#8217;s dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty shrugged.  &#8220;Technomancers would have emergency power supplies.  And Sight that helps with working with tech in that kind of darkness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that takes time, right?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;A minutes or two where the phone apps might not work and the Turtle Queen can move?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess.  I feel like I&#8217;m in a weird spot,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere you are is the best spot,&#8221; one goblin said.  Another goblin shoved that goblin over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;But I want Musser to chill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all want Musser to chill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you want him to chill and go away and don&#8217;t get me wrong, I want to get him to do that too.  Your town, Avery as guardian-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us as guardians, technically,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, but like, I know her, she&#8217;s one of the guardians, I talk to her online a ton, I like how her head works.  She can be a bit clueless sometimes, but if you&#8217;re there to make sure she gets the clues&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have tried,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Including with her and you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Liberty said, quiet.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.  Lucy elbowed Verona again.  Verona elbowed Lucy, exaggerated, drilling elbow into ribs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably actually my fault she was so slow to get a clue, at least a bit,&#8221; Verona admitted.  &#8220;&#8216;Cause I got on her case about other stuff, for fun, and she got stubborn about it.  And then when I did it about her and you, trying to maybe get her to think about it, she got stubborn and maybe like, closed that door in her head?  I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe drop it?&#8221; Lucy asked, quiet.</p>
<p>Liberty shook her head.  &#8220;It&#8217;s cool.  It&#8217;s my fault, and hers for being clueless.  I wasn&#8217;t obvious enough, she didn&#8217;t get it, I missed a shot, probably better in the long run.  She&#8217;s with someone now, right?  And it&#8217;s a great girl she doesn&#8217;t have to be long distance with?  I&#8217;m happy for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Me too,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Anyway,</em>&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;Weird spot.  Because I want to protect this town for you guys and Avery, cool, but I also don&#8217;t want to make super huge enemies?  So it&#8217;s a weird spot to be in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really glad you came,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;You backing us up.  You could&#8217;ve tried talking to America and then left after, you could&#8217;ve not come at all.  I wouldn&#8217;t have faulted you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have a little bit,&#8221; Verona said.  She jumped a bit as a goblin glared up at her.  <em>Lots of little yes men.</em>  <em>And women.  And gender-free.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  It&#8217;s cool.  Take me to that arcade later.  Before I leave.  I&#8217;ll consider us square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can.  Depends how things go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty nodded.</p>
<p>She kept her right hand where it was at, and goblins pushed and shoved to have their heads under the hand.  She pointed across the street.  &#8220;They&#8217;re planning on calling in a pretty big goblin.  It could be one of three.  One likes to come out or be summoned at night, one needs a certain offering to eat and that <em>has</em> to be a pain to acquire, and one&#8217;s pretty vicious&#8230; she&#8217;d need to protect herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has some Legendres around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Liberty said.  She frowned.  &#8220;I was hoping to see some clues.  If all the curtains were drawn or something.  Or if they were bringing in a lot of really weird meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of weird?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhhh, chest meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like another goblin we&#8217;ve heard of,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Breastbiter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!  Holy shit.  The legend spreads, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy glanced at Verona.</p>
<p>Verona supplied the answer, &#8220;He participated in the Carmine Trial.  Against John.  Against Charles.  Like John he went in and he, uh, didn&#8217;t come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No kidding?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No kidding,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gods and spirits.  I guess that&#8217;s a special name we remove from our notebooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s either one that comes out at night or a vicious fighter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll know by observing.  I can put my guys on it,&#8221; Liberty said.  &#8220;If they start preparing as it gets dark, the goblins can alert me and you guys it&#8217;s probably Smudge Eater.  If they start bringing the Legendres around and everything circles around those guys, we&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s probably Slaygarrrrrr Who Slavishly Slays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slaygarrrrrr,&#8221; various goblins echoed, almost reverent.  &#8220;Who Slavishly Slays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it like that every time?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  You have to, actually.  Or he gets power over you.  Respect the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Verona replied smiling a bit.  &#8220;Others are fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are!&#8221; Liberty exclaimed.  &#8220;Look, you guys look tired, you look like you&#8217;ve been working your asses off and fighting and you&#8217;re maybe down a bit.  I&#8217;d be down too if a cute freckled girl with strawberry blonde hair up and left this morning too.  In fact, I am a bit down about it-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not how I&#8217;d phrase it but technically right,&#8221; Verona told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get it okay?  But I think this can all work out okay.  Just gotta deal with the goblin first.  They&#8217;re probably going to wait until innocents are in bed.  I think I can help with that part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to Toadswallow?  He knows this stuff.  I mean, he taught you,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>Liberty made a low gurgling sound in her throat, like she really didn&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can deal with the goblin, I have ideas on how to deal with America,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Verona?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Get the word out to whoever you need to talk to, let&#8217;s get chow, so we&#8217;re full and strong for when they do this-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Nahhhh,&#8221; Liberty said, looking over toward the cabins.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been near a lot of battles.  They&#8217;d be acting different.  It&#8217;s not soon.  Tonight.  After innocents are asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona felt like she wanted to question some of that positivity, especially when it went so far as to think Anthem would change his mind, or that America might back down.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; maybe Liberty knew something they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I get my own food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Eat with us.  My mom would probably be really happy to put a face to the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to put fake teeth in like I did for Ave?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming over?&#8221; Lucy asked Verona.  &#8220;And for tonight?  Sleepover?  You asked.  I hope it&#8217;s okay, Liberty staying too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Though I&#8217;ll have someone at my place another night.  So that&#8217;s a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.  &#8220;M?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Codes?&#8221; Liberty asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for you, I&#8217;ll tell you later,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Just&#8230; we <em>just</em> managed to pull off some chaos in the enemy ranks as you arrived, because it was hard to tell which goblin was on which side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust these guys,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you even keep track of all these?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure,&#8221; Liberty said, looking around.  &#8220;If one&#8217;s a traitor, it&#8217;s one of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope not,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta get stuff.  To stay over, and to be ready for a fight,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Wait, that was a dumb way to put it.  Just- see you, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona left Lucy and Liberty behind, as the two were talking to the goblins, organizing watches and describing what to look out for.</p>
<p>&#8216;Good luck&#8217; felt a lot like it was pretty appropriate.</p>
<p>Verona was tired and it had little to do with sleep, exactly, and somewhere in the middle of art class, she&#8217;d clicked as to why- that little thing in the background that was nagging at her.</p>
<p>She wished she could do city magic again without negotiating with Lis.  She had to leg it back.  From downtown past school, to the bridge, across, and into her neighborhood.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t announce she was home.  She went up to her room, not really <em>trying</em> to be silent, but also not making noise for similar reasons.  It sounded like her dad was downstairs.  Mostly, she wanted to not be bothered for the however many seconds or minutes it would take her dad to realize she&#8217;d come home.</p>
<p>&#8216;Home&#8217;.  She had a home now, a place to go, and it was safe and it was cool.  She&#8217;d had weeks to stay at Jasmine&#8217;s and prepare for going back to her dad&#8217;s, and that had been anxious and weird but now it was somehow worse.  Because she&#8217;d braced herself for the return home for a while and now it was like-</p>
<p>-it was like she&#8217;d received a permanent invitation to Jasmine&#8217;s.  And in this imaginary scenario there wasn&#8217;t any friction with Lucy and she had her own space but it was still a bit of a sleepover every night, and there was someone on the couch in that room with the other parents, the other two, and Charles.  Someone who represented her and backed her up.</p>
<p>Except it was a house.  It was enticing in a completely different way.  Lonelier, though a bit better with McCauleigh there to hang out with.  But it was hers.</p>
<p>When she&#8217;d gone back to her dad&#8217;s after a long vacation with her mom and a longer stay with Jasmine, it had been a completely different decision.  Because there&#8217;d been no other option, really.</p>
<p>She hadn&#8217;t anticipated how much she&#8217;d hate the idea of going back now.  Because there was another option, this time.  It wasn&#8217;t necessarily a <em>perfect</em> option, but neither was going home.  So it was kind of like she was putting that toothpick under her toenail and kicking the wall repeatedly for no reason at all.</p>
<p>In a lesser way, it was the same for going to school.  There was another option.  It wasn&#8217;t a <em>good</em> option, but going didn&#8217;t feel like a good option either.  It just felt like misery.  And knowing there was another route, of just doing her own thing?  That made being there really hard.  Especially because she knew she needed to make a token effort at being <em>here</em> too.</p>
<p>She looked at her Fetch stuff in the corner.  Abandoned.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t a good option either, but in an existence of compromises&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Wouldn&#8217;t she really rather the adventure of a doppleganger her trying to steal her life, instead of the drudgery of school?</p>
<p>Probably.  She still didn&#8217;t touch the Fetch.  But now that thought had occurred to her.</p>
<p>There were three thumps on the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona!&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shut her eyes, not replying.  She opened her eyes and got her stuff sorted out.  More spell cards.  Some trace glamour stuff.</p>
<p>Goblin stuff meant chains were good, she had one of those.  Lighter for fire&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sleepover too.  She got toiletries, and then packed a change of clothes.</p>
<p>While she was at it, she remembered McCauleigh&#8217;s nightmare.  She packed some old bras.  Was it weird to give an old bra?  Maybe.  But maybe she could make a joke, like, <em>don&#8217;t call me bro, call me bra-</em></p>
<p>Her door opened.  &#8220;Verona!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see we&#8217;re back to you opening my door without knocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see we&#8217;re back to you not replying when I call your name?  Two things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First off, in the basement?  There&#8217;s a bed, a bedside table, a dresser, and two bookshelves that need assembling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very close to having the basement finished.  You need to help some, okay?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She rubbed at her hand.  Then she saw him looking down at it and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay?&#8221; he asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The standard noncommittal response, I see.  The sooner we get it done, it&#8217;s <em>done</em>.  We can rent out the space, that&#8217;s more money for the household, which helps us both.  It means I&#8217;m easier to deal with, it means you&#8217;ll be happier, I have to imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t actually care that much about money or things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  When you don&#8217;t have any money I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll think differently.  Second thing?  Your mother got in touch.  She said it was important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?  Why not tell me that first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because if I did you wouldn&#8217;t listen to the rest of what I have to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I call her?  Will she call back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said to call anytime this afternoon or evening.  She&#8217;d be near the computer.  She was never there for me, so I guess it&#8217;s up to chance, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s important?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s needing to go to the hospital.  Will you visit <em>her</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, seriously.  Do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s pregnant.  She might have a new man in her life.  Or woman.  Who knows with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I asked.  Okay.  Goodbye, leave.  My room, my space, remember?  My freaking boundaries?  Knock!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dad almost rolled his eyes as he shut the door.  He stopped just short.  &#8220;Work out a system of communication with that woman?  I don&#8217;t want to ever have to talk to her, important or no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona pushed the door shut, and he basically let her.</p>
<p>Verona hurried to get her laptop set up and plugged in.</p>
<p>She dialed, then sat cross-legged in her chair.</p>
<p>Waiting for the system to load.</p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock</em>.</p>
<p>She squirmed in her seat.</p>
<p>Then as soon as it was loaded, she clicked the number on the side of the video call window.</p>
<p>She rubbed at her hand as the icon transitioned through a loop, showing the call in progress, connection not yet made.</p>
<p><em>Tick tock tick tock</em>.</p>
<p>Her mom appearing on the black screen almost startled her a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heya.&#8221;</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t sound like an emergency voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?  What&#8217;s important?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Important?  Oh.  I told your dad because he was annoyed I called, I worried he wouldn&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona deflated a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Um, okay, cool, uh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted up her hands and dropped them back into her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you free?  I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m interrupting your dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  The plan is to go over to Lucy&#8217;s soon.  Then stay over for a sleepover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  Fantastic.  You&#8217;re still doing that- on a school night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t really matter.  Are you going to put in the parental veto or?&#8221; Verona let out a half-chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  No, um, but the reason I called- I talked to Jasmine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shut her eyes for a few seconds, digesting the possibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said I should be in touch.  Even if it&#8217;s outside the usual call schedule.  I don&#8217;t know if she thinks something&#8217;s up- I asked, she didn&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded, relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess from my position, ever since she told me early this afternoon- she called around two-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when her shift ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I guess it sounded a whole lot like there was something important, like what you thought, at the start of the call.  But she wouldn&#8217;t say what.  That it was for you to tell me.  If you wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.  Well, I&#8217;m not pregnant or getting married or going to the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona wasn&#8217;t exactly sure how to respond, but like&#8230; her mom wasn&#8217;t being <em>compassionate</em>, exactly.  Not striking that tone or anything.  At the same time, though, her mom talking about being worried about Verona like Verona had just been worried about her mom took a big sledgehammer to something inside Verona, and made her feel like she could cry if she let herself.</p>
<p>She shrugged, not saying more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8221; Verona started.  &#8220;&#8230;yes, or maybe.  I don&#8217;t know.  It&#8217;s a lot.  It&#8217;s all been a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ever-&#8221; Verona took a deep breath.  The words didn&#8217;t flow right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to come?&#8221; her mom asked.  &#8220;To me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona dropped her head, eyes looking into her lap.</p>
<p>Moisture welled in her eyes and she closed them carefully.  So it wouldn&#8217;t leak out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Other stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Offer stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly everything, feels like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that <em>is</em> a lot.  I- I hope I don&#8217;t sound condescending.  That wasn&#8217;t the intention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re okay,&#8221; Verona said, quiet, rubbing at her hand.  &#8220;You ever, um, you ever do a big project for work or school, and it&#8217;s this huge thing that takes up a huge amount of energy, and time, and thinking, and everything else gets pushed to the background?  And then you finish, and- and then there&#8217;s everything, right there?  And then it catches you totally off guard, and you can&#8217;t deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been there.  Quite a few times.  There&#8217;s always a letdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well this was big, and I guess the letdown is&#8230; I&#8217;m not even sure if this is the right answer.  I&#8217;ve been trying to work out why all day and I don&#8217;t know if this is it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I ask what the project was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I- I might show you one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence on the other end was loud enough that Verona looked up at her mom.  Her mom was looking off to the side.  Getting water or something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; her mom replied.  &#8220;But it was big?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Super big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And successful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow.  Okay.  Congratulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona snorted a bit.  &#8220;Thank you.  I&#8217;m wondering what you think it is, but I&#8217;m afraid to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve mentioned mysterious projects in the past.  I know you&#8217;re artistic.  The water bottle purchases?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that department.  You have to be here to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.  I&#8217;d like to be there.  I could make a visit this weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  There&#8217;s- there&#8217;s a lot.  There&#8217;s&#8230; no.  You have to be here to stay,&#8221; Verona said, quiet.  &#8220;Or it&#8217;s not fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, her mom was inscrutable.  Hard to read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeling down, then?  And Jasmine got worried?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Jasmine was worried for different reasons</em>.  <em>She wanted to prompt me to tell my mom, maybe, without outright telling her herself.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like, it&#8217;s more than feeling down.  But it&#8217;s a lot to get into.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re going to Lucy and Jasmine&#8217;s later?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, well, if you want to talk, I can stay on as long as you want me to,&#8221; her mom replied.  &#8220;I ordered dinner fifteen minutes ago, they might be knocking on my door soon, but besides that, I&#8217;m here.  If you want to talk another day, schedule allowing-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tash ditched me.  You remember Tash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember Tash.  I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why had she started with Tashlit?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s friend<em>ly, </em>but she&#8217;s not- she&#8217;s around and she helps me out sometimes but it changed.  I think she&#8217;s avoiding me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that&#8217;s-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a boy I was friends with, an artist boy, Jeremy- he ditched me.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why?  </em>I remember you mentioning Jeremy.  Why would he-<em>&#8220;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Because he got a girlfriend and he wanted me to be his girlfriend and then when I wouldn&#8217;t he got another one and ditched me and it <em>sucks</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, wow, okay.  Two heartbreaks, there, huh?  Close together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I&#8217;m not doing super well in school right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the CAS worker you talked to had conversations with your teachers.  I think if you&#8217;re upfront about what&#8217;s going on, they&#8217;ll cut you some slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Mr. Bader, or Mr. Sitton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re right.  What happened?  With school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped paying attention for a little while.  Other stuff seemed more important.  And now it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t understand five straight words out of my teacher&#8217;s mouths a lot of the time.  And it&#8217;s not even that important in the grand scheme of it all, but that makes it worse-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;School is <em>very</em> important, but that doesn&#8217;t mean this isn&#8217;t fixable.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s not important compared to everything else, that&#8217;s the thing</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point, even?&#8221; Verona asked, head bowed, hands pressed into her calves, legs crossed beneath her.  &#8220;Except that I don&#8217;t want to worry Jasmine or Lucy, and I made promises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To what?&#8221; her mom asked, and it was very carefully worded.</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep working at school.  To hold onto <em>normal</em>, I guess.  It&#8217;s not me.  I&#8217;m not- the more I get a taste for other stuff, the less bearable all of this gets, you know?&#8221; Verona asked, breathing that last word more than she spoke it.  &#8220;The rules, the conventions.  Feels like everyone&#8217;s got boyfriends and girlfriends and they&#8217;re doing great at school and they don&#8217;t have this other <em>sh-</em> crap to worry about, and even Lucy seems to manage somehow, and I&#8217;ve found things I&#8217;m good at.  Places I want to be.  I want to quit being&#8230; human.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to think of what to say-&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona heard the sound of a doorbell.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s my food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona started laughing to herself, not making a noise, just with her body shaking.</p>
<p>The doorbell kept ringing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to- if I don&#8217;t answer he&#8217;ll keep dinging the bell.  I&#8217;m with you, I want to answer, just- pretend I&#8217;m sitting here thinking really hard about what to say, because that&#8217;s not far from the truth, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doorbell continued in the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very good at pretending.  Okay.  get your food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona&#8217;s chair creaked as she rotated a few degrees one way.  She twisted her body and reversed the rotation some.</p>
<p>She imagined her mother sitting there, thinking super hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Normal,&#8221; her mother said, &#8220;is overrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so too,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Sorry to whinge at you like I just did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure it&#8217;s probably what dad did to you before the divorce, and you got away from it, I guess, and good for you.  Cool that you can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Verona.  No.  I want you to share this with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the feeling, of being in school, and it feeling like everyone&#8217;s having sex or out dating&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Literally more than half the class is dating, I&#8217;m pretty sure.  Small town, people get bored, and I think some girls are playing matchmaker.  It&#8217;s super dumb.  But there you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, well, I can at least tell you, in my experience, that people your age aren&#8217;t out having sex, okay?  It felt that way, but ten times out of ten, it turned out to be just talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Verona replied.  <em>No comment</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels overwhelming, and it feels awful to be behind-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unbearable, just about,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like I can barely sit through class at this point.  Like I&#8217;ve got other stuff to do and I&#8217;m wasting time, or they&#8217;re going at this racing speed saying things I don&#8217;t understand and I hate it.  It feels dumb or it feels like <em>I&#8217;m</em> dumb  I hate it.  I hate it- I&#8217;d-&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona stopped herself short.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you going to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That it felt like- I had an itch on my arm earlier today.  And I felt like, I couldn&#8217;t scratch it.  Because if I did, I&#8217;d keep scratching until my arm was bleeding.  Like&#8230; like a cat with her leg in a trap, gnawing the leg off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So bad I can barely work out what the teachers want me to work out.  Which just makes it worse, or I spend all my time trying to make sense of why I hate it or why it&#8217;s that bad and then I miss stuff.  I just&#8230; hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should eat.  Or I could just like, tell you I&#8217;ll try and suck it up a bit longer and end the call and go eat at Jasmine&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t- let&#8217;s figure this out, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shrugged.</p>
<p>But her mom got the food containers open.  It looked like Indian food.  Curry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you need?&#8221; her mom asked, focused on not spilling as she ate at her keyboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I need?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just- let&#8217;s make sure that if we&#8217;re solving problems and figuring this out, we&#8217;re fixing the right things.  What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona looked around her room.  She worried half the responses she could give would give her mom the wrong impression.  <em>Escape.  To be gone from here.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time.  To do the things I want to do.  A lot of things.  Things that I&#8217;m good at.  I think if I could, I could be really great.  I really think that.  But I gotta do school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty non negotiable.  Legally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona made a face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time.  Okay.  I went out to lunch with Kelsey last week.  Before she went to Kennet- that happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  Their late Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool you talked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice.  Especially without the chaos of the-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-of the Kelly kids,&#8221; Verona finished, as her mom said something approximate.  &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her husband homeschooled, she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh wow,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Wow oh wow.  I can just imagine.  If I feel like a cat about to chew through its leg to get away in school, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d feel like if fucking Dad was homeschooling me, wow, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me finish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh god.  Oh, myriad spirits.  Oh no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only meant to say&#8230; there are options.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be school like you&#8217;re doing it.  And it doesn&#8217;t have to be your dad teaching you as the only alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh gods and spirits, thank you, good, holy shit, can you imagine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona laughed a bit at the absurdity of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are independent learning courses.  Online.  Or we could ask the Kellys if they know someone who was in the homeschooling community who you could homeschool with now.  Perhaps you&#8217;d go over and we could pay them to supervise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me just going over to some random&#8217;s house to study with their kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just putting ideas out there.  There <em>have</em> to be options, okay, Verona?  I&#8217;m a firm believer in that.  Let me talk to David, from CAS.  And to your dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad said I should find a way for you to not have to call him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your dad can get over it.  It&#8217;s part of being a parent.  Is he okay?  Is the situation there unbearable too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like it is at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Good.  I&#8217;m going to call David, okay?  Tomorrow.  Talk about options, see what&#8217;s out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d mean leaving Lucy behind.  And we&#8217;re already drifting apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s unbearable it&#8217;s unbearable.  Let&#8217;s look into options.  And I think- I&#8217;m not very good at maintaining deep friendships, so take what I&#8217;m saying with a grain of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re inseparable.  You might go your own ways for brief whiles, but you&#8217;ll rebound and come back together.  I believe that.  Not like you used to be, but in a different way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It scares the crap out of me.  That we might not rebound sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then work at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you lost your other two friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to let you go?  To Lucy&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk more, if you meant what you said,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Okay, absolutely.  Great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I go put some food in the microwave and come back?  And I gotta text Lucy.  Tell her I&#8217;ll meet her after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretend I&#8217;m here saying really cool, thoughtful stuff, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona went to do that.  The microwave beeped as she punched in the time for some microwaveable butter chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona!&#8221; her dad hollered from the basement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Busy!&#8221;</p>
<p>She texted Lucy, got her food, and then headed back to her room.</p>
<p>One of her rooms.  She had a magic house, she reminded herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very thoughtful and interesting things,&#8221; her mom said, as she pulled her headphones on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevermind.  You know, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very good at being a wife.  Just to- to go back to what you said before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me a wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and not wanting to be Jeremy&#8217;s girlfriend.  And possibly being aromantic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom put that out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know how much similarity there is, but I don&#8217;t think I was very good at being a wife, and I haven&#8217;t felt the inclination to do anything since divorcing your dad.  Maybe if I&#8217;d drawn boundaries or examined myself like you&#8217;ve been doing, I could&#8217;ve avoided a lot of grief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could&#8217;ve avoided having me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that worked out pretty well, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any great advice.  Sorry.  Just sympathies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sympathies are nice.  Hey, uh, can I ask?  How would you be at helping me with my social studies homework?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a look.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;You good?&#8221; Lucy asked, as Verona walked over.</p>
<p>Verona nodded.  &#8220;Better than I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talked to my mom, worked stuff out.  Might make adjustments.  I&#8217;ll get into it another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner was okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona looked over at Liberty, who was trailing behind.</p>
<p>After about a minute of short responses, Liberty hung up.  Then she sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We good to go?  Dealing with a big goblin and seeing what we can do about your sister?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ideally talking this out, but I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Liberty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you talking to Avery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, and Avery&#8217;s been talking to a lot of people.  Word on the street, according to her, is that my daddy&#8217;s on his way into Kennet tonight.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p>Biscuit sang as her skateboard coasted through Warrens dreck and bum scum, leaning hard one way or the next.  &#8220;With my thoughts all troubled and a belt unbuckled&#8230; addicted to youuuuoooouuuuuu!&#8221;</p>
<p>The skateboard dropped down a vertical section.  She felt the vague attention of an innocent, where this section passed by a grate.  She hurried to get out a slightly off-beat, &#8220;Boo!&#8221;, scrambling down the length of the skateboard to brace her shoulder and doll head against the box that was attached to the board.</p>
<p>The board hit a bend, and with a brain-jarring shift in frame, started going horizontal again.  Her being where she was helped keep the box from catching the board and just squashing her.  Bottles rattled within.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a fly zipped down and a lipstick frown, what do I dooooOOoooooo?&#8221; she sang.</p>
<p>The skateboard made the awkward transition from Warrens dreck to pipes.  She hadn&#8217;t really been here before, but it was mostly similar.  She alternated between choosing a destination and letting the way her body bounced as she sang to the music in her head decide her course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Champagne bubbles, cuddles, I&#8217;m in, deep trouble, my head, it&#8217;s empty, you gave, me plenty, it&#8217;s not what I need&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;OoooooOOh!&#8221;</p>
<p>She coasted out of a drain, into a street on Kennet found, and pumped a fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;With your shirt unbuttoned, my thoughts upended&#8230; addicted, to youuuoooouuu!  Woo!  A sniff of courage, my thoughts demurraged, what do I dOOooooOOooo!  Phew!&#8221;</p>
<p>The box on its shitty little wheels bucked and tried to fall over, or to tug the back end of the skate board to throw her wildly off course- off a ledge.  She threw her weight this way and that to try to compensate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Embrace, it&#8217;s cold, gold, go down, I&#8217;m easy, my heart, it&#8217;s empty, you gave, me plenty, it&#8217;s not what I need&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rather unexpected set of stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;OoooOo-&#8221;</p>
<p>She hit the landing of the stairs, skateboard and box falling around her.</p>
<p>The fact she was wearing something that could almost be called a helmet and the fact it had ended up being useful somehow circled around to being ironic.</p>
<p>Face-down, she sang-screamed into the sidewalk, &#8220;-ooooOOooOh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone picked her up, and her legs paddled at the air instinctively.  They turned her to face them- a guy with a sock pulled over his head, peering out of a hole in the heel.  It was hard to tell at first, but he was ten feet tall and very skinny.</p>
<p>Biscuit stared back, wearing a plastic doll&#8217;s head over her head.  She&#8217;d drilled out the eyes and the mouth, then applied lipstick around the mouth hole for the illusion of lips.  The polyester golden locks tickled her shoulders.  Her body wriggled as her legs kept paddling at the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;You okay?&#8221; Sockhead asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!  I&#8217;m tough.  Put me down?&#8221;</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>Then he helped her right her skateboard and put the box upright.  No leaks.  Good.  Some papers had fallen, where they&#8217;d been in a slot at the side of the box.  Biscuit fished through some.  &#8220;Sir!  A discount!  For being nice!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the paper.</p>
<p>She left the other papers there, after verifying they weren&#8217;t too important.</p>
<p>She ran alongside the skateboard, pushing it, then heaved herself onto it, belly down, as it started to roll.  Greased by some WD-999 and Nonspecific Warren Lube, the box and skateboard&#8217;s wheels actually got a little faster as there was more resistance.  The box bounced hard against the back of the skateboard, jarring her as she got back to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent our hour, I take a shower, what did I dooooOooooo!?  Ooh!&#8221; she sang.  &#8220;Money on the counter, ending our encounter, what will I doOOOOoooOooo!?  Boo!&#8221;</p>
<p>She swerved around a kid that chose an awkward moment to reach right and pick a flower that was growing out of a crack in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first, I&#8217;ll burst, in tears, I&#8217;ll fall, I&#8217;ll crawl.  Flat bubbles, no cuddles, you gave, me plenty, it&#8217;s not what I neeeded&#8230; this gold, it&#8217;s cold, go down, not easy, you gave, me plenty, it&#8217;s not what I needed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She purposefully tipped the skateboard because it wouldn&#8217;t roll to a stop on its own.  She tugged on the rope behind the box to have it propel itself forward some.</p>
<p>A man was out trimming his hedge.  He was old, and it looked like he&#8217;d taken white hair from every haircut and beard trimming he&#8217;d given himself to shroud his head in hair, so it looked like he had a bristling, uneven mane and thick beard, eyes peering out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; she shouted.</p>
<p>He looked down at her.  &#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to open an establishment on the corner of your property.  I won&#8217;t be long.  I&#8217;ll pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;ID and papers?  I don&#8217;t want trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached up the bottom of her dress and pulled out papers.  There was one piece of paper with &#8216;BISCUIT&#8217; scrawled on it, a picture of herself taken from a distance, while she was passed out, and a tiny handprint.  Then there was the various paperwork she&#8217;d filled out for fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Filled this out all wrong,&#8221; he said, gruff.  &#8220;Wrong answers in wrong places.  Unless you live at a phone number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rule of discourse,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m a sloppy girl like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s alright then,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>She held up a handful of bills.  He had to lean into and over the fence to reach down enough to take it.</p>
<p>Toadswallow had brought back Kennet found money and he&#8217;d exchanged it for any of them who asked.  She wasn&#8217;t sure if Toadswallow had cheated them, but the old man seemed okay with it.</p>
<p>A lot of the goblins had asked for the amounts with the Cherrypop on it, so they could wipe their butts with it and annoy Cherrypop, but Cherry hadn&#8217;t really understood, so they&#8217;d left it lying around.  Biscuit had grabbed it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme finish?&#8221; he asked, indicating the hedges.  &#8220;Wont be long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gotta set up so that&#8217;s okay.  I won&#8217;t be in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh hey, what does milk cost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Milk?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was her best point of reference, since Cherry kept looking for money to go buy some, leaving money behind whenever she stole from the store, for some reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine.&#8221;  He pulled out the same money he&#8217;d taken from her, and showed her one amount, to indicate.</p>
<p><em>Three opossums.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Coo, thank you sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>With ropes and shoelaces tied to shoelaces, she gradually hoisted her skateboard up at the corner of the fence on the property, then propped it across to form a platform.  With the wheels of the skateboard set to spinning, superlubed up, ropes tied to them, she winched the box up.  It took a few quick catches and extra ropes helping to keep the skateboard from dislodging itself from the weight.</p>
<p>She cracked the box open, unfolded some cloth, and draped out cloth signs, one along each of the two sides of the fence.  The first one had her face on it badly drawn but with the essential details there, with the store sign &#8216;Biscuit&#8217;s Mix-its&#8217;, and the other had drawings of the various offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fall, in love, with every, one, they gave, me plenty, it&#8217;s not what I needed&#8230;  OoooOooooOOohh!&#8221;</p>
<p>A music box both served to fill in the gap between the skateboard and the front corner of the fence, and filled the neighborhood with tinkling chimes and drum beats.</p>
<p>The open panels of the box could be roped to the skateboard, serving as a lower shelf she could climb down.  She arranged bottles and concoctions on it.</p>
<p>Already, some curious people were approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come one, come all!&#8221; Biscuit greeted them, hurrying to get more things in place.  Money set aside to be change, papers, some warning slips for more common goods.  &#8220;Biscuit&#8217;s mix-its stall!  Limited stock, sampling for my wandering stall in Kennet below!  Sometimes I&#8217;m here, sometimes I&#8217;m there, sometimes I&#8217;m gone!  It can be a treasure hunt, but they say the best treasure is an experience and I sell <em>buttloads</em> of experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>More were arriving.  The old guy was looking out his window, annoyed at how loud her music was.  But she&#8217;d paid him well enough he seemed willing to tolerate it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adults, you&#8217;d better buy so the kids don&#8217;t, kids?  If you want teenage rebellion, you&#8217;d better look elsewhere, because this is a re-<em>hell</em>-ion!  Here we go!  Regular booze, it can make you black out, but this here, it&#8217;s what we call <em>All-out</em>.  I&#8217;m talking blackout, knockout, shout-out with your bits out!  Gotta get something done?  Twenty people ready to pound you?  Down as much as you can, worst case, you won&#8217;t experience any of it!  But there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll find yourself face down somewhere hours away, you kicked allll their asses, got yourself hitched to some rando, said all the things-&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone came forward.  &#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Or, special deal, might be a one-time deal, who knows?  You can have <em>all</em> of it, free!  What a deal!  But if you do, you gotta have all of it.  You and me, we&#8217;ll have an adventure.  I&#8217;ve got references, if you need it.  Interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen, you said?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh.  Deal stands, if any of you are interested!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody was.  Or at least, not out loud.  He paid.</p>
<p>Two more came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-one,&#8221; she told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;He paid eighteen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Early buyer&#8217;s discount,&#8221; she said.  She took their money as they shelled out, a little disconcerted it was this easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all out of All-out!  If you want some more, gotta find me at the Kennet below market!  But there&#8217;s more!  Before I get to other fun substances, here&#8217;s something else you could find at the market!  A knife!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had their full attention as she stabbed herself through the eye-hole of the doll mask, both hands gripping the knife handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t hurt!  How badass do I look?  My stuff, it&#8217;ll make you drunk, sloppy, tipsy, topsy, you&#8217;ll be numb, fun, lost, and dumb.  But what the heck do you <em>do</em> when you&#8217;re sloshed and awash?  You stab yourself!  Put your hand on a table and stab between your fingers, then finish off by stabbing yourself in the back of the hand and shouting, hoooraaaaah!  Badass!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made three failed attempts at pulling the knife out of her face, her hand slipping on the grip.  Someone helped, then kindly laid the bloody knife down beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you guys how it works if you agree not to share.  Yeah?  Cool!  The less you act like it hurts, the less damage it does!  Let some other schmuck try it on himself for laughs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could pretend it hurts and make the damage worse?&#8221; a man asked.  He had bandages wrapped around his head, only mouth visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh, I guess.  But you could use a regular knife-&#8221;</p>
<p>He was already pulling out money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paid.  She took the money, folding it, before tucking it aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to set yerself down for a good long while, go properly numb?  Get properly ossified with all-de-hydes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried that one,&#8221; a guy at the back of the crowd said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statue still, uncomfortably numb.  That&#8217;s- forty,&#8221; Biscuit doubled the price at the last second.</p>
<p>From how easily that got paid, she wondered if she&#8217;d still asked for too little.</p>
<p>She heaved the bottle up.  &#8220;Gosh, you guys like booze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Red moon&#8217;s coming,&#8221; a woman answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Should be fun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break from routine, turn over rocks, look for any trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!  And the violence!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly against intruders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw.  Here!  Now, this powder does have the side effect of making you weirdly obsessed with dragons&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did that one too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone else pulled out money to pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even say the good part yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having passions is cool,&#8221; the guy said.  &#8220;Dragons are cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot less fun!&#8221; she protested, even as she took the money and handed over the packets.  &#8220;You gotta agonize some!  Twist in the wind!  Will you get this moment of awesome, for this horrible price?  Being <em>super</em> into something?  You might get a dragon tattoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re buying for the price!  It&#8217;s like getting a cursed item for the curse!  Against natural order!&#8221;</p>
<p>The masks gave nothing away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!  I&#8217;ll remind you all, deal stands, if you like this stuff, you can have it all, free, if you&#8217;ll agree to do it all.  Adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did that once.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cocked her head to one side, and her neck fat did a bulge-shift where the neck of the doll head she&#8217;d pulled down over her own slipped to one side.  &#8220;Did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a bunch of cool stories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gotta say, you&#8217;re stealing my thunder a bit here, guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes I did,&#8221; he said, before walking off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, there was business, so she couldn&#8217;t stay too disgruntled.  A lot of them seemed to want to black out or stay occupied during the red moon thing, instead of doing cool things, but the money was being handed over, and there wasn&#8217;t much commotion, so she was okay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Special offer&#8217;s still a thing!&#8221; she shouted, as people came and went.  She had to duck her head down and crank the music box, fixing the cog at the side to the endlessly spinning skateboard wheel, and when she poked her head up again, she saw someone in a plain white mask.  She sniffed at the air.</p>
<p>Human.</p>
<p>Invading practitioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, practitioner,&#8221; she said, as she sorted out the money that had gotten a bit disorganized.</p>
<p>He raised a hand.  He&#8217;d drawn something on it &#8211; two circles meeting toward the top of a line, with an &#8216;x&#8217; at the halfway point of the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go practicing on me,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Not supposed to be allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not.  Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You a repeat offender?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Myles Sutton.  Alchemical restoratives.  You&#8217;re a goblin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!  Want something to take your mind off your troubles?  Slow Suicide?  Devil in a bottle?  Rusty Cage?  The A-Hole?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got seven days of civility classes to get through.  I think, uh, that&#8217;d be a fast way to screw up and get more days tacked onto my sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Guilt Trip!&#8221; she said, holding up a pill with a walking stick figure on it.  &#8220;Or is this the Ego Trip?  No, it&#8217;s the first one!  Short trip.  No telling what you&#8217;ll do, but it&#8217;ll be a thrill!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a lot of regrets after?  I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wimp.  Oh, you want it?  Fifty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, the cash here is only really useful here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can get supplies for bigger, cooler stuff.  Plus customers.  Customers who might bring better cash next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very forward-thinking for a goblin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a girl with goals, Myles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to compare notes?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only if they&#8217;re cash notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was writing down the vendors and things where you can get alchemical supplies.  Stuff you could use to brew that stuff.  I&#8217;d trade it for info.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmmmm,&#8221; she considered.  Even if she didn&#8217;t end up using it much, Verona was doing alchemy.  &#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me get us started.  I&#8217;m curious, I hear the uh, less militant practitioners are all bailing this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.  And that&#8217;s going okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!  But some are staying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any word on Cyn?  Or Mr. Martin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet!  They&#8217;re undecided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Here.&#8221;  He showed her an address.  <em>Birds and bird related ingredients</em>.</p>
<p>She took a note with one hand while taking money with another.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; someone pointed at a small bottle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not for sale,&#8221; Biscuit said, before moving it aside, so it was in view but not in <em>everyone&#8217;s </em>view.  Just hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the man asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it secondhand.  Makes you an addict if you&#8217;re not one.  Makes it worse if you are.  S&#8217;called Something To Die For.  But it gives you something.  Fate and shit, yeh?  Someone to love, who makes it all worth it.  True love, reason for being.  Agonizing conflict.  Is that something going to be the high you chase or the person?  But it&#8217;s expired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why keep it then?&#8221; Myles asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;like, uh, you know how some people have the first dollar they earned on the wall?  That&#8217;s like my dollar, but it&#8217;s something I want to make one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate practices like that, worked into alchemy?  Have to be some crazy ingredients.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh.  Ten to fifteen engagement rings, and they gotta be ones that have good &#8216;sociations, too.  Two to five dog tags from dogs that died happy and loved, no pain.  BFF charms from dumb school girls who were the best of friends.  An&#8217; so on.  Melt them down, remove impurities.  Then you gotta, gotta make booze out of what you got.  Gotta make it <em>great</em> booze.  Or it&#8217;s all wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Involved,&#8221; Myles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gonna be special.  Might not be my first Barney, or my second, but I&#8217;ll have one- you know what a Barney is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myles shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gonna be a goblin pal of someone on a <em>legendary</em> binge.  That someone&#8217;s my Barney.  And one day, when one of them are down and out, wondering what the point is- easy to get there, I think.  But if they&#8217;re special and there&#8217;s no other way, and there&#8217;s still that one thing left to do, that&#8217;s going to be the magic moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dragging someone else into that mess?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a magic moment! </em> A lot of the time, a Barney finishes their legendary adventure and they&#8217;re done.  But this time, it&#8217;ll be all like, like hey!  You done so good!  Good job, just trust me this one last time, drink this.  And they will, and there&#8217;ll be a whirlwind of action and everything coming together, fate, that one person coming into their life in the middle of it, trigger the downfall of a country, end up accidentally in space, accidentally solve an equation that changes the world!  And then someone nurses them back to consciousness, they look each other in the eyes&#8230; and I&#8217;m there, hidden away, mostly forgotten.  They swear off the drugs and booze, get true love as their big reward for the best run ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if the inherent magic of that particular dose overrides that whole &#8216;they usually end up sober after&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!  No, not allowed!  Don&#8217;t even say it!  Have to believe it&#8217;ll work!  The rest of it, the adventure, that&#8217;s a story I&#8217;m going to tell all the other goblins, and I&#8217;ll be a legend!  I get into places, I get free stuff, they lift me onto their shoulders, treat me like a little queen!  But the one bit, where it ends in love?  That&#8217;s for me.  That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all for!  This!  Right here, this, the fighting, figuring how to make this stuff, hunting for my first Barney, all of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was breathing hard now.  It was hot inside the plastic doll head she&#8217;d crammed her own head into, even though it was cold outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;For that moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yus.  Ever since I first heard of this drink.  I already knew about Barneys.  I couldn&#8217;t sleep, I liked the idea of that moment so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Foundlings around her little fence-stall were standing back, listening.</p>
<p>She was glad that one guy wasn&#8217;t around to say he&#8217;d done it.  She&#8217;d have gone for blood, whatever the rules were.  Still breathing hard, she sat herself down, which wasn&#8217;t a long trip with how short and stubby her legs were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Myles folded the paper he held, showing her a line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bunch of cool ideas.  If we&#8217;re comparing notes, I might as well pay for that too.  Didn&#8217;t know stuff like that existed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you steal my idea-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do, I know of drinks that&#8217;ll make you do terrible things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She huffed, and the heavy breath whistled briefly through the round hole in her helmet-mask.  &#8220;Speaking of.  Devil in a bottle?  Nobody will think you&#8217;re mild mannered ever again!  Not after you let your inner devil out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two people came up to buy some of the small bottles.  One of them was wearing a Biscuit mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a discount because you&#8217;re cute,&#8221; she told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just curious,&#8221; Myles said.  &#8220;Did you clear this with the Founder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I filled out the paperwork!  If she doesn&#8217;t like it, she should have made it against the rules!  Next blood moon&#8217;s going to be a party.  Can I get a woo!?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a &#8216;woo&#8217; from roughly half the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys shuffle over that way.  Yeah.  You too, sir!  And you, over to that group.  Yeah, everyone who gave me a woo gets a discount.&#8221;</p>
<p>She quickly sold the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to ask if you&#8217;d seen my friend, or if you&#8217;d pass on a message, but I&#8217;m out of information to trade,&#8221; Myles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard there&#8217;s a bunch of wacky alchemists who tried to work together and screwed it all up somewhere near here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Write down their names?  And one thing you know you might not?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The labs were pretty thoroughly ransacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Write!&#8221; she pointed.  &#8220;And tell me your friend&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easton Songetay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gauntlet boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Super short hair, angry face, big coat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cranky?  Full of himself?  Aggressive?  Loses a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Don&#8217;t turn around and say you have no idea who he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t suppose I could get you to give him a message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dangerous for me.  He binds goblins.  Or tries.  Tried to bind a Foundling.  I&#8217;ll pass on word though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meet at the fountain?  The one with the little girl?  I&#8217;ll be hanging out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be a while,&#8221; one Foundling commented.  &#8220;He&#8217;s doing the intensive three-day course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit.  I figured seven days was a good way to look around, gather some info.  Like the vendors.  Okay.  Thank you.  Can I fill out a memo?  As thanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; the Foundling said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Biscuit said, looking up at him.  &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why gauntlet boy?  Is it a little romance?  Is he your Something To Die for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Just a friend.  Hard to explain, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him her best puppy dog eyes.  The doll head didn&#8217;t really help though, but she pushed through.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s&#8230; really cool when he&#8217;s cool.  Which isn&#8217;t often, but like&#8230; we&#8217;re fourteen year old guys.  Pretty hit and miss about whether we get to be cool in the right ways.  Sometimes we&#8217;re cool in ways adults like, but uncool in all the rest.  Sometimes we&#8217;re cool in like, we got school down on lock, but uncool the rest of the way.  Sometimes we&#8217;ve figured ourselves out.  And so on.  Easton, right now, luck of the draw, parents he got, he&#8217;s cool in the way that other girls our age think is cool.  For the rest of it, you gotta kinda&#8230; look past some stuff?  You see it in the moments he&#8217;s not paying attention and stops trying so hard.  Where he&#8217;s pretty cool in general.  And maybe you end up hoping he&#8217;ll end up chilling out and settling down that way for good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;ve been cool, talking like this.  You&#8217;d be cooler if you bought up and chugged some of my stock, but&#8230;&#8221; Biscuit said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  No thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and you&#8217;re friends with this guy?  He&#8217;s Cherrypop tier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any idea what that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grabbed a bill and held it up.  &#8220;A one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.  I&#8217;d argue that, but there&#8217;s rules about arguing with goblins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In general.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But did what I say make any sense?  About&#8230; coolness?  We&#8217;re half formed adults, can&#8217;t always choose what gets prioritized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  A lot of my friends are like that.  Part of being a goblin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.  I want to argue that, but I just- I- the first two arguments that came to mind contradicted my point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you&#8217;re half formed and you don&#8217;t form any more than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Cherrypop, maybe.  And gauntlet boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s a question,&#8221; she said, standing up.  &#8220;Big question.  If we&#8217;re half formed but we&#8217;re going to become fully formed, who&#8217;s doing the forming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really good question,&#8221; Myles said.  &#8220;Wow.  I&#8217;ll have to sit on that for a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer now,&#8221; she insisted.  &#8220;Answer, answer, answer&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She motioned.</p>
<p>About three people in the group of ten that were hanging out nearby joined in.  She motioned for them to join the group that got the discount, and motioned for the one who&#8217;d joined in for both things to come forward.  &#8220;Freebie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No idea!  I forget.  But I think it&#8217;ll be cool.  Now go away.  This dope needs to give an answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A goblin with a dream and some profound questions, huh?&#8221; Myles asked.  &#8220;I guess I&#8217;d say, hmmm, I suppose the ones shaping me and Myles would be our families, except our families are becoming subordinate to Abraham Musser, right?  So Musser&#8217;s shaping us, deciding how we&#8217;ll be when we&#8217;re fully formed.  Which is pretty key to watch out for, since I think he sorta likes Easton.  I know Wye does.  For similar reasons I do, I think, but maybe they want different end results?  Food for thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuh uh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?  Huh.  Figured you were trying to lead me to that conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You.  You shape yourself,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Jus&#8217; gotta be in the right place, around the right people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around.  &#8220;And here I am, in this Founded place, taking civility classes, learning goblins can be deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So deep, but that&#8217;s not it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about experiences, and the way to get to the right places, right people?  <em>Drugs</em>.  <em>Alcohol</em>.  Cut loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah huh,&#8221; he said, sounding disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stock&#8217;s almost run out.  Last chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you&#8217;re still half formed,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Next!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pass on my message?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a thumbs up, and handled the last few transactions, stopping the music box partway through.</p>
<p>She packed away the money, then put away the rest, before cutting the ropes.  Skateboard, box, and banners all got sorted out, banners jammed into the box, box put together then hitched to the board.  She had to untangle the knotted ropes from the wheels where they&#8217;d been used as winches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks everyone!  Be sure to visit the market!&#8221; she told the stragglers- mostly people standing around to chat with one another.</p>
<p>Myles walked with her, while she pushed the skateboard along, climbing onto it to let it trundle along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Need a carry up the stairs?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; she saw.  She noticed he&#8217;d rubbed the mark off his hand.  &#8220;Got ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>She steered the skateboard toward the road, and toward a manhole cover.</p>
<p>She had enough connection to the Warrens that it was pretty easy to get through.  The moment she hit the manhole cover, it flipped, letting her through into another space behind.</p>
<p>She dropped, stomach plummeting, and hurried to get everything roughly balanced so she could hit the curve at more or less the right angle.  She banked off the curve in the pipe about twelve feet down, then raced forward, through fetid air that only got more fetid-y.  Then it broke into smells of feet and tiddy, then other smells besides.</p>
<p>She hit the muck and the ride became smoother, and harder to control.  Up, bank off a corner- over-</p>
<p>She belted out the words to her song, starting over.</p>
<p>&#8220;With my thoughts all troubled and a belt unbuckled&#8230; addicted to youuuuoooouuuuuu!&#8221;</p>
<p>One grate- nope.  A shadow passed over it, and she knew it was a human shadow.  She coasted onward.  Manhole cover- the light shining through those little squares reached all the way down a short side tunnel to the wall at the T-junction, one square blocked.  More humans.</p>
<p>By the hue of the light, it was morning, people were starting to get up and getting stores ready well ahead of opening hours.</p>
<p>She skidded forward, avoiding a hazard.</p>
<p>More shadows, more sounds.  Running, splashing footsteps.</p>
<p>She made a sharp turn, hoping- she knew there were two exits here, three if it was trash day downtown, and it wasn&#8217;t trash day.  If both were blocked-</p>
<p>The goblins came running after her.  They were as fast as her skateboard.</p>
<p>In the gloom of the caverns, lit only by the occasional light from the human world, she could only see their eyes.</p>
<p>Fork- she only had half a second to decide which fork to go down.  She judged the light.</p>
<p>There was activity on both sides, but if she felt out-</p>
<p>She coasted hard right.  The goblins were right behind her, claws scratching for a hold on the box.</p>
<p>Slight downhill, speeding her up just past the reach of their claws, then an upturn-</p>
<p>She bounced her way free of a duct cover that pointed out into a gap between dumpsters.  Biscuit, the skateboard, and the box all tumbled onto pavement in a back parking lot.</p>
<p>There were people coming around the corner.</p>
<p>Goblin hands reached out from behind her, leaving her unable to duck back toward the dumpsters.  She didn&#8217;t want to abandon her stuff.</p>
<p>Hands reached up from above, grabbing her and the rope connecting the skateboard and box.</p>
<p>Biscuit was brought into the dumpster, then tumbled a short distance, out through a duct behind the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;My lady,&#8221; Toadswallow said, as he polished a broken glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not your lady!&#8221; Biscuit protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bubbleyum was her rescuer.</p>
<p>&#8220;She nearly got snatched up,&#8221; Bubbleyum said, standing.  She stepped up onto a rung of Toadswallow&#8217;s stool and kissed his cheek.  Then she looked down at Biscuit, clearing her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;  Biscuit fished through her stuff and got some money, and handed it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell is this?  Toilet paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like what the goblins were using as toilet paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Cherry dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Toadswallow said, taking the money.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you something nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should be getting me something nice anyway,&#8221; Bubbleyum said, poking him in the butt cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes dear.  Gladly.  How was your errand, Biscuit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!  Sold out!  Weird money, weird customers, but it was good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  You mentioned the market?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was after you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only got a glimpse.  They looked like America&#8217;s group,&#8221; Bubbleyum said.  &#8220;They&#8217;re after anyone going through the lower areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s old enough for a spanking,&#8221; Bubbleyum said, before blowing a bubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me sentimental-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sentimental,&#8221; Bubbleyum and Biscuit said, at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh,&#8221; Toadswallow replied, sighing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Met one of the invaders,&#8221; Biscuit said.  &#8220;Myles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark on his hand?  He tried to show me it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit went to a puddle on the floor and drew moisture out into the right general shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not practice,&#8221; Toadswallow croaked the words, contemplative.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so anyway.  What does Myles do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alchemist,&#8221; Biscuit replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not alchemy either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gang sign,&#8221; Bubbleyum said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Way of telling friendly goblins apart from the rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bubbleyum nodded, another bubble in process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that off your head?&#8221; Toadswallow asked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s distracting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit removed the doll head, but it was a process, and she ended up needing Bubbleyum&#8217;s help to tug it past the general chin area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she have so many goblins she needs a way of identifying them?&#8221; Toadswallow asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think so.  Not <em>yet</em>, at least.  There are enough dumb practitioners in town, she could need a way for them to tell ours apart from theirs,&#8221; Bubbleyum replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or both.  Bringing more in, organizing the people who are behind.  Myles is an alchemist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh.  Knew stuff,&#8221; Biscuit replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your read on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too straightlaced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smart.  Kind.  Thinks too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t sound like the usual group here,&#8221; Toadswallow mused.  &#8220;He was with the aggressive invaders?  If he&#8217;s a repeat offender?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend of gauntlet boy.  The one who kidnapped the rabbit mask girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that explains it.  Okay.  That warrants some investigation.  Up for an errand, Biscuit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell no.  I just got back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.  Doglick, come!&#8221;</p>
<p>Doglick barked, and in his haste to find his way over, he bowled past two sleeping goblins in one of the cushioned booths across the abandoned bar.</p>
<p>Biscuit climbed up onto a shelf to avoid being in the path of eager, rear-end-wagging destruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that mark on the floor?&#8221; Toadswallow asked.</p>
<p>Biscuit pointed.</p>
<p>Doglick yipped.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to Kennet found.  Do we know where this Myles boy is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fountain of the black dog girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow nodded.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t take the usual routes.  There&#8217;s goblins waiting to ambush anyone coming by.  Go show yourself.  See what he does.  If he shows you a symbol.  Then watch, see who he interacts with, how he handles himself.  I&#8217;ll send someone by to get a report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Doglick&#8217;s too dumb for all that,&#8221; Biscuit said.</p>
<p>Doglick wagged his rear end, making a coughing sound that might have been an ill-timed attempt at a bark, when there wasn&#8217;t enough air in the right place.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good boy,&#8221; Bubbleyum said.  &#8220;Do it and you get a treat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doglick scampered off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go get yourself sorted.  Rest if you need.  Shit may go down today, our rep as goblins is important,&#8221; Toadswallow said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh,&#8221; Biscuit agreed.  &#8220;More your rep than mine.  I could say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could also get booted out of town, if you can&#8217;t do your share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did some already.  If you want a bit more, maybe I get a bit more?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He leaned back, looked at Bubbleyum, then reached into a pocket.  &#8220;Because you did good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always do good.  If you&#8217;re cute enough, everything is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not that cute,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very cute for a goblin,&#8221; she said, giving him her best puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; Toadswallow said.  He handed her a paper.  She unfolded it.</p>
<p>A new brew.  Punch Drunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoo.  I want my lady to put her tongue down my throat and tickle the inside part of my belly button.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only if you ask nicely,&#8221; Bubbleyum told him.</p>
<p>Biscuit left them to their own devices, dragging her stuff behind her, on her way to the lockers.  Part of running a market meant that there was a need to store stuff in places, and it could all go really wrong if there was any theft.  The lockers at the back of the bar were one place that things could be stored- especially things like Biscuit&#8217;s box and skateboard.  At the back of the room, larger areas had been marked out, with gremlin rigged electric wire fences stretching across wooden cube shapes with doors.</p>
<p>But a place like this needed a guard dog.  The one on duty was Bluntmunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi B.M.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Biscuit.  Drop your stuff off and go.  I want to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was big, fierce, strong, and he had to be so&#8230; frustrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want company while you sleep?&#8221; she asked, giving him the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Lift me?  It&#8217;ll get rid of me faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put a hand out, then lifted her high enough to access the combination lock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, Blunt, I know I can&#8217;t give you any really fun drinks, or it might break the binding they all put on you-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmm.  Less talk, more going away?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;-but if you wanted something else, like an experiment, see if you could put a rocket launcher in a 9 mm holster, if you know what I mean, I&#8217;m open to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  You&#8217;d die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>She removed the lock, let him lower him down to the floor, and lifted the box in.  It helped it was mostly empty now.</p>
<p>She heard a voice.</p>
<p>Miss.</p>
<p>&#8220;-selling obscene amounts of very strong, very dangerous chemicals to the Foundlings-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand she did the paperwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did.  In a very goblin way.  It took so long for the people processing it to decipher it that she got forty five minutes to sell before absconding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a good word.  Absconding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she here?  She and I need to have a conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit hurried, motioning.  She got lifted up to the lock, and latched it shut.</p>
<p>&#8220;She just left.  We should have a conversation, though.  I have reason to believe there are secret messages being passed around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have reason to believe you&#8217;re changing the subject.  She&#8217;s primed a disaster of wildly inebriated foundlings to explode around the time the next blood moon comes.  Did she leave the room or left the premises?  Don&#8217;t play games with me, Toadswallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s left the-&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit hurried for the nearest vent, sliding into the shallow Warrens.  She waddle-ran to the next nearest opening, a building away.  She knew Toadswallow would sense her departure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever wonder if we&#8217;ll all be together again?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re together now, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean.  Together, like we used to be.  Working mostly as a unit.  Without, I dunno, walls up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get it,&#8221; Verona said, quiet.  &#8220;Together but not <em>together</em>, kind of.  Moving in separate directions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucy sighed.  &#8220;A bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona had just finished her Demesne claim.  Avery was packed and ready to go.  Verona would be going to school soon, so would Lucy.</p>
<p>But they were in the middle of one last thing.  They hadn&#8217;t wanted to leave <em>just</em> yet.</p>
<p>The kids, their parents, some goblins, two Dog Tags, the Vice Principal and the Bitter Street Witch were all present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry if I&#8217;m a big part of that,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Us not being <em>together </em>together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not, Ave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if we&#8217;re never, hmm, meshed again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s something that takes effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to put in the effort when we&#8217;re constantly scrambling,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Do we postpone this?  For a few weeks?  Months?  The almost two years before Avery comes back to Kennet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends what happens, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The parents were hanging a short distance back.  Lucy&#8217;s mom was wearing scrubs.  Avery&#8217;s dad murmured something to his wife, then to Lucy&#8217;s mom.  Lucy&#8217;s head turned a fraction.</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom was a nurse.  Nurses had access to medications.</p>
<p>Biscuit waddled over, leaning against the wall near Lucy&#8217;s mom&#8217;s ankle.  The top of her head came up just shy of the woman&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Biscuit.  I&#8217;m the cutest goblin here,&#8221; she said, giving Lucy&#8217;s mom her full-power puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh wow.  I have a reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow, Miss, and Louise entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we go,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>Biscuit shrank back against the wall, doing her best to look innocent.  Miss didn&#8217;t have eyes but it felt like the non-eyes were on Biscuit.  She squirmed a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we doing?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;Am I good to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow answered, &#8220;We have a Tedd problem.  Our goblins have confirmed, they&#8217;re bringing in more, using secret signals to organize, and they&#8217;re already taking action against the market.  They waylaid some of our merchants.  America Tedd is leading them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the town hall in Kennet below?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Bitter Street Witch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; Louise said.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll handle it, and there&#8217;s apparently something in Thunder Bay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl and her goat who are apparently some huge mega-trap waiting for us there, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>After</em> school,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;Oh my god I sound ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fine,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I phoned Mrs. Wint from the council to let her know.  Which might be like throwing a truckload of fertilizer on a bomb, but maybe she can handle it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our daughter knows about fertilizer bombs, should we be proud or worried?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blame media.  That way we can put it in the same bucket as the Declan problem.  Spare my sanity a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some tentative plans for the meantime,&#8221; Miss was saying.  &#8220;You girls don&#8217;t have to be directly involved, but if you did want to be part of this to smooth things over with certain groups-&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery was glancing back at her parents and asked Lucy something, got an answer, then turned, &#8220;You&#8217;re comparing me to <em>Declan?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Focus, please,&#8221; Louise said.  &#8220;You said you didn&#8217;t have much time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;School and Avery leaving, yeah,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry.  It&#8217;s stupidly early, even for me,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;By certain groups, you mean Liberty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the more ambiguous goblins,&#8221; Toadswallow said.  &#8220;We have reason to think they have goblins in Kennet above, Kennet below, and Kennet found&#8230; someone in Kennet found was communicating with goblins, talking to and coordinating with those above.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myles Sutton.  Easton Songetay is working with him on that now, but Easton is busier, doing the three day course.  Myles is taking point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myles challenged my claim because Easton egged him on,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Said as much.  He&#8217;s friends with Easton like that.  Seemed decent but I guess he has crummy friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So our goblins say,&#8221; Toadswallow said, glancing at Biscuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me, I said it,&#8221; Biscuit told Lucy&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many goblins are suggestible,&#8221; Toadswallow said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; Biscuit told Lucy&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;America has a lot of influence.  She&#8217;s a minor celebrity.  I know at least one goblin working in the markets has a picture of her, drawn with a five year old&#8217;s ability, pinned up in their workspace.  Liberty stands a few rungs lower, because she&#8217;s younger, but the Liberty adherents are <em>rabid</em>.  She&#8217;s less exciting, but she&#8217;s gentler and kinder, and many goblins don&#8217;t get much gentleness or kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t, but I do my best to give some,&#8221; Biscuit told Lucy&#8217;s mom.  &#8220;I&#8217;m cuddly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Liberty&#8217;s imminent arrival, we face a tug of war over the hearts of the goblin population,&#8221; Toadswallow said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s shitty, but I&#8217;m basically here to give Liberty a quick hug, a thank you and then I gotta leave,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;If that&#8217;s okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re engaged in tug of war, losing Liberty in any way would lose us the fight.  A hug and thank you helps.  From the tone of her reply, it sounded as if she feels obligated.  Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Which doesn&#8217;t make me feel any less crummy about how this is playing out,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;How were the Garricks?  I know you called,&#8221; Louise said.  &#8220;But they sounded like they were in earshot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;Twenty-one safely transported away.  They&#8217;re going to take Liberty out when she&#8217;s done here.  They&#8217;re open to more.  No issues, everyone was delivered safely.  It&#8217;s not the outcome we all wanted, they can&#8217;t do more trips without getting Gainsaid by the Carmine Exile, but it&#8217;s ok.  Some of them are going to come back after, if that&#8217;s alright.  To visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright with me,&#8221; Miss said.  &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer if one of you was with them, if it&#8217;s no trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that safe?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Them coming back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno, but I think it kind of walks a line?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&#8230; what was his name?&#8221; Louise asked.  &#8220;Peter Garrick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  He got cleared of the gainsaying pretty easy.  That part&#8217;s mostly handled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning our most immediate problem is America Tedd.  And she&#8217;s a key figure in the group of remaining invaders,&#8221; Miss said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And our second big problem is Musser is coming back, reasonably soon?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Louise, Miss, and Toadswallow nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Liberty can&#8217;t handle the America problem, then I&#8217;m going to want to,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with violence, I hope,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  Biscuit nodded her silent agreement, to see if that scored any points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I can help it.  Violence is her language.  I&#8217;d rather make her bilingual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No idea what that means,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;It sounds menacing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant to sound badass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six out of ten,&#8221; Verona told her friend.  Lucy elbowed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on then.  Tally ho and scatter.  Be at the ready.  Goblins,&#8221; Toadswallow called out.  &#8220;You&#8217;re with me!  If we&#8217;re to to do this, we need to break up America&#8217;s support.  Let&#8217;s distract and dissuade those who would help her in our little game of tug of war.  If you&#8217;re wondering if you should use things you could sell, talk to me.  I&#8217;ll pay you back some.  But if this goes south, so will our market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit didn&#8217;t budge, watching as the rest went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we do something about that middle contingent?  Send someone?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or just let them free?&#8221; Verona offered.  &#8220;What if we went to Myles and convinced him people were leaving?  Time it so they&#8217;re split up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we don&#8217;t have to be deceptive about it?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Miss was talking to the Dog Tags now.</p>
<p>The parents stood by, just observing, looking really concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we can be friends,&#8221; Biscuit told Lucy&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the goblin that deals drugs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit opened her mouth into an &#8216;o&#8217; and covered it.  &#8220;Wherever did you get that idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of you has a thing you do very well and yours is magic drugs, right?  My daughter gave me her notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you have gotten such a terrible idea?  I&#8217;m a big believer in <em>anti-drug</em> programs,&#8221; Biscuit said.  She moved to where Lucy&#8217;s mother couldn&#8217;t see, close to the back of her feet, making the woman step aside.  Biscuit hastily got a pen out and scrawled letters on her shirt.  When Lucy&#8217;s mother was looking at her again, Biscuit had the letters DONT on her shirt, which she&#8217;d taken off a child&#8217;s doll.  She held it out.  &#8220;See?  Drug opposed network something or other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t there before, I remember that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve even got a song though!  I&#8217;m Biscuit, drugs?  Don&#8217;t risk it!  Drugs fantastic?  Don&#8217;t be a basket-  Case!  Case the joint.  Joints are bad-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Biscuit!&#8221; Bubbleyum barked, making Biscuit jump.  &#8220;Why are you wasting time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming!  I&#8217;ll sing the entire song for you later, okay?&#8221; Biscuit told Lucy&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t those anti drug programs notorious for being ironically worse and driving people toward substance abuse?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked,  &#8220;Is that why you like them?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Right on the money.</em>  Biscuit ignored him and hoped Lucy&#8217;s mom would too.  &#8220;Drugs are bad so you should give me all the drugs and all the medicines that could be used as drugs for safekeeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom shook her head.  &#8220;No.  I&#8217;m not going to do that.  I think you need a new gimmick, Biscuit.  Because this one sounds pretty terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being anti-drug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a drug vendor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look!  I&#8217;m perplexingly cute as goblins go.  It&#8217;s charming!  That lets me get away with stuff!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with me.  I haven&#8217;t seen enough goblins to be able to compare easily, but I have to say, the ones who <em>don&#8217;t</em> deal drugs are far better in my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit gasped, horrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re actually saying I&#8217;m not cute!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Biscuit!&#8221; Bubbleyum called out.  &#8220;Get moving or else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m not cute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You definitely won&#8217;t be cute after I put my foot so far up your ass you can see the outline of my foot pressing out of your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit gasped again, double horrified.</p>
<p>She hurried away, pausing halfway across the floor to give Lucy&#8217;s mom her best puppy dog eyes.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t deal drugs, exactly.  I deal in cool magic that&#8217;s got booze and drugs as part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;  Biscuit turned it up another notch, then let her face rest when that didn&#8217;t get her anywhere.  &#8220;Tits and balls, damn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stomped the rest of the way to the nearest Warren-hole.  Bubbleyum was waiting there, looking grumpy.</p>
<p>Biscuit smiled a bit unevenly, then hopped down the hole in the floor.  If the hole in the floor was a throat, then it was a question of intention about which way she&#8217;d go.  A throat could bring something into the lungs or bring something into the stomach, and Biscuit wanted to go to the stomach-area.  She disappeared into darkness and she didn&#8217;t hit the unlit bit of sub-floor on the far side of the hole.  Her feet found slick metal, and she skidded her way down the scum-lined pipe.</p>
<p>She loudly hummed the beats of her song.  Her short legs and sack-like body made her center of gravity low, which helped with keeping her balance while sliding down the slick, angled tunnel.  Her eyes adjusted to the dark.  Butty had moved off to a side tunnel, getting at a stash of something oily, and leered at her, smiling as he got it all over himself.</p>
<p>And Toadswallow was right behind her, picking her up and lifting her to his shoulder.  He managed their descent, monocle glinting every time they passed a light source.</p>
<p>His voice was a croak in the darkness.  &#8220;You&#8217;re plenty cute as goblins go, but stay away from the parents for now.  They&#8217;re still adjusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toward the town hall!&#8221; Toadswallow told the gathered goblins of Kennet that had slowed at a flatter portion.  He skidded to a stop, facing them all.  Biscuit hopped down.</p>
<p>About half the goblins present looked at one another.  Of those who didn&#8217;t, about half stared at him blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no civic responsibility.  The dog statue where you were rubbing the part between the legs to see how shiny you could get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>About half the goblins knew where that was.</p>
<p>&#8220;And split up!  Above, below, found!  The three girls are meeting us there, but they don&#8217;t want to take the Warrens!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were shouts of agreement.</p>
<p>The goblins took separate paths, spreading out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you what your stock is worth,&#8221; Toadswallow said, voice low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; Biscuit asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you put it to good use, I&#8217;ll pay you one and a half times what it&#8217;s worth.  If you put it to <em>great</em> use, I&#8217;ll pay double.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toadswallow,&#8221; Biscuit said, putting one hand on her hip.  A nonspecific organ shifted where it had been pressing against skin.  &#8220;Are you trying to impress your old student?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America too.  Gotta show her what&#8217;s what.  Knock some sense into that head.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached into a vest pocket and pulled out an engagement ring.  A diamond glittered in Warrens gloom.  &#8220;See this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to ask Bubbleyum to marry you!?&#8221; Biscuit asked, before hugging his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Not-&#8221; he paused.  &#8220;Not yet.  Not with something this lame.  It&#8217;s gotta be way better.  It&#8217;s for you.  Advance payment.  I know you&#8217;re keeping an eye out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my Something To Die For?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took it, clutching it close to her most heart-approximate organ.</p>
<p>Toadswallow started on his way down, sliding on his rear end, feet out in front of him, one hand trailing the wall.</p>
<p>They were partway down when goblins came at them from either side- brothers, by the looks of it, with beaks and mean looking eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaa!&#8221; Biscuit shrieked.</p>
<p>A claw-tipped hand that reached for her disappeared into a blur of white.</p>
<p>Bubbleyum, again, snapping out, to take in hand, forearm, and elbow.  She bit three times in rapid succession, at different points in the arm, and bubblegum mixed with torn flesh and blood, until it was really hard to tell what was what.  The goblin, eyes widening, looked at the goblin that had been lurking just behind Toadswallow, well hidden.</p>
<p>Bubbleyum bit the attacking goblin&#8217;s face, before pulling her head back, tatters of flesh, strings of blood, strands of bubblegum, bloody flesh, bloody bubblegum, and gummy flesh stretching from the torn up goblin to her lower face, and connecting the goblin&#8217;s arm to its head.  Her eyes glowed pink in the gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch him,&#8221; Bubbleyum told the other beaked goblin, rather pointlessly, because she pounced on him a second later.</p>
<p>She glanced back at Toadswallow and Biscuit.</p>
<p>Biscuit hid the ring before Bubbleyum could see and get jealous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best you go ahead,&#8221; Toadswallow told Biscuit.  &#8220;Hurry along.  I have things to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Like your gum-chewing lady?</em>  Biscuit thought.</p>
<p>But Biscuit went ahead, aware there could be more ambushes waiting.  &#8220;With his fly zipped down and a lipstick frown, what do I doooOOO!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;OooOOo!&#8221; she heard Ramjam down one tunnel, and went that way.</p>
<p>And there were more ambushes, but enough goblins were ahead of her that they&#8217;d sprung the various traps.  Three goblins were trying to get a grip on Butty.  Two more had bound Nat&#8217;s arm behind her back with barbed wire.  Biscuit angled her slide to bowl her way past their legs.  &#8220;Champagne cuddles, bubbles, I&#8217;m in, deep troubles!&#8221;</p>
<p>And it only got worse as she got further down.  Doglick was being drowned in mud.  More goblins were cornering Kittycough.</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t get past-</p>
<p>And the one she&#8217;d bowled over was coming after her now.  Nat was up, punching, but that wasn&#8217;t good for a lot.</p>
<p>It made Biscuit think about being small, new in the Warrens.</p>
<p>Before she&#8217;d found her crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight!  Line up!  Bangnut, weapon form!  Biscuit!  Weapon form!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the boss of us, Tatty!&#8221; Biscuit shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be!  Next in command after Toadswallow and Bubbles!  I run the Casino!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a referee!&#8221; Biscuit shouted.  &#8220;Sometimes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I run it enough!&#8221; Tatty raged.</p>
<p>Tatty got more aggressive as she did.  She was really easy to piss off and she got more intense when pissed off.  Everyone knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Toad!?&#8221; Ramjam asked.  He had smaller goblins trying to pull him facedown into the Warrens dreck by holding his horns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting stuff!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need stuff!  We need to beat them up!&#8221; Tatty shrieked.  &#8220;Get them!  Fight harder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>You</em> fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>How could they win a tug of war like this?</p>
<p>Biscuit had slowed because there was so much to wade through down there, and no clear path forward that wouldn&#8217;t get her smashed like a wet paper bag filled with hard boiled eggs.  But the goblin was coming behind her-</p>
<p>And she didn&#8217;t have a lot.  She didn&#8217;t have tricks, or anything to drink, or pills, even.  She&#8217;d stowed that earlier.  She only had-</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?  Look at me, I&#8217;m too cute,&#8221; she said, before posing as best as she could.</p>
<p>The goblin looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a goblin as cute as me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couple times,&#8221; the goblin growled.</p>
<p>She gasped, indignant.</p>
<p>The goblin moved closer, pulling out a hacksaw with barbed wire wound around the saw part.</p>
<p>Help came, but it wasn&#8217;t Toadswallow.</p>
<p>Bluntmunch, released from binding, maybe, or temporarily released, came down the tunnel.</p>
<p>He was big enough to almost fill the tunnel, but moved so he avoided crushing Snatchragged in passing. He put a foot out and forward, and pushed the goblin that had been moving on Biscuit into the muck, stepping on him to use him like a sled for his right foot.</p>
<p>He pushed against the tunnel and lifted up so he coasted by Biscuit, legs on either side of her, and collided with that mess of fighting below.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t hurt their guys.  He gave each of the goblins he passed some kind of hit, whether it was flinging them neck first at a wall or hitting them with a meaty, hairy fist that was like a head-sized piece of concrete at the end of a pipe.  Others he pushed down and deep enough into the muck they couldn&#8217;t get back up.</p>
<p>Some got back up, but it was a much easier fight.</p>
<p>Biscuit used the opportunity, hurrying off to the side.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t a fighter, not really.  She was an enabler.</p>
<p>She went toward the smoke-tinged morning light, down one side tunnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biscuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not running!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said.  He reached into his vest, and pulled out a dingy handbag.  Glass clinked within.  He threw it to her.  &#8220;From your locker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You went into my locker!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s an odd concept, Biscuit,&#8221; he said.  He turned his head, monocle glinting as he did so.  He looked down the sloping tunnel where there was still audible fighting.  &#8220;But you can trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to believe we all rise to the level others see in us.  I used to think that meant having what it takes to defend what you have, kill if you gotta.  But if I really believed that, would I be giving you a fair shake, little Biscuit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you shake me, I can&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s going to fall out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm, yes. This is all a leap of faith, still.  I trust you, but you&#8217;d best get jumping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How high?&#8221; Biscuit asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good answer.  You decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grabbed the handbag, adjusted it, and then carried it free of the Warrens.</p>
<p>She paused at the manhole cover that would take her out onto the street.  She could hear Ramjam singing indistinctly.  She could usually get him singing with little prompting.</p>
<p>And Bubbleyum was badass and Snatchragged was fierce and Toadswallow was&#8230;</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Uncomfortably non-goblin but not in like, the worst way.</p>
<p>She took a moment, balancing her bag on one rung of the ladder, and fished around for things.</p>
<p>She made a mark on her forehead, because her hand was too small.</p>
<p>Then she managed her way up the ladder, past the manhole cover, and into Downtown Kennet.</p>
<p>Things were moving.  People from Kennet below were getting organized.</p>
<p>And people from the invaders were here too.  America&#8217;s spot was a rallying point, with a lot of goblins.</p>
<p>A lot from the market.  Biscuit recognized some as ones who&#8217;d managed stalls.</p>
<p>There were even more in the tunnels, and apparently near Kennet above and Kennet found.  If the fighting stopped, they&#8217;d come here, probably.</p>
<p>America was hyping them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that on your forehead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit looked up.  Gashwad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get close.  It&#8217;s too many.  I was going to stab someone important.  Really mess &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that on your forehead?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mark she&#8217;d seen on Myles&#8217; hand.</p>
<p>She moved around one building, then approached from an open angle, near the flanks, moving through sparse grass that was dying as the weather turned.  The ground was cold underfoot, and leaves crunched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up!&#8221; a man shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the mark!&#8221; she shouted, pointing at her forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not good enough to have <em>just</em> the mark.  What&#8217;s the password?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would I know the password?  Look at me.  I&#8217;m very cute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re&#8230; a bit cute.  For a goblin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!  How&#8217;s a goblin supposed to be this cute and smart enough to remember something like that?  You&#8217;re asking too much, man!&#8221; Biscuit shouted.</p>
<p>The man folded his arms.  He had a wonky curved dagger.  Maybe an implement.</p>
<p>She acted super confident as she walked down to a point about five feet away from them, and set her bag down.  What had Toadswallow packed for her?</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s the mark on the forehead mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicks,&#8221; Biscuit answered, right away.</p>
<p>Safe bet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two out of three, at least,&#8221; the younger guy told the knife guy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got stuff here.  Fun stuff.  Drink thirty minutes before any fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be fighting before thirty minutes is up,&#8221; the knife guy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.  Here.  Three things&#8230;&#8221; she put down three bottles.  &#8220;Drink &#8217;em.  I guess sooner than later, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to drink something strange from a goblin, sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biscuit sighed.  &#8220;But it&#8217;s <em>awesome</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grunted her displeasure, then packed up two of the three bottles, leaving the tallest one in the dirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forgot one,&#8221; one of the men told her.</p>
<p>She waddled away as fast as she could.  &#8220;Got work to do and I&#8217;ve got small hands.  Do whatever with it.  Sell it maybe!&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to the next group, which took a minute.  &#8220;Forehead, gots the mark!  Means dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut off dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh!  And I&#8217;ll do the same for you I did for the last group.  One bottle to drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed it on the ground near their feet.  She saw them look at the other group that was holding the loose, half-circle perimeter around Kennet below&#8217;s town hall.  At the bottle on the ground there.  She waddled on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if we don&#8217;t want to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No skin off my nips,&#8221; she told them.</p>
<p>America was still working the crowd.  If she turned around, would she recognize Biscuit as someone not from her gang?</p>
<p>The three witches and Miss had been talking about removing the smart ones &#8211; giving Myles a way out.  It sure would be nice if there were only meatheads and fighty types left behind.  Nobody to do a quick magic read of this stuff.</p>
<p>She reached the next group.</p>
<p>And she glimpsed Gashwad in hiding, motioning frantically.</p>
<p>When she passed the group without giving them anything, Gashwad relaxed.</p>
<p>He knew something she didn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>It did mean restarting for the next group.  &#8220;Mark on head, cut off dicks, woo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Password?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cuter than I am smart, so I don&#8217;t know.  Here.  Drink it or don&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m just making deliveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so on.  Gashwad crossed the street behind some of the Bitter Street Witch&#8217;s soldiers, keeping an eye on her.</p>
<p>He was smiling.</p>
<p>She dropped some pills off for the next group, then a bottle for the next.</p>
<p>As she reached the last group, America was sending the goblins out.  She held her ground as the goblins ran past, and stayed out of America Tedd&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Very cool look.  The top hat and spiked armor over a gaudy, ill-fitting suit.  She almost wanted to join in.</p>
<p>But she remembered the others.  Ramjam singing.  Toadswallow being weird.</p>
<p>Gashwad met her as she carried on, hurrying on her way until she&#8217;d reached a dark alley.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d drawn the mark on himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Why not that one group?  They&#8217;re kids.  Kids are dumber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hennigars.  They were at the school.  Clever, educated, and they can scream out to War, fight past anything you try to give &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, it wasn&#8217;t realistic for anyone to go ahead and take any.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;d encountered nine groups holding the perimeter.</p>
<p><em>One</em> group was dumb enough.</p>
<p>One group saw that group partaking and took that as a cue to do it too.</p>
<p>Two out of nine.</p>
<p>America whistled, calling goblins over.  Biscuit had to move over to see why.</p>
<p>Liberty Tedd was walking down the street, hands in the pockets of a cute sports coat with spray paint on it, sunglasses on.  She wore short jean cut-offs even in the cold weather, her shoes and calves dirty from taking a Warrens route, and she didn&#8217;t seem bothered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So cool,&#8221; Biscuit murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshht,&#8221; Gashwad scoffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You psshhht so many cool things.  Like being part of the group.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshht.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Liberty&#8217;s arrival, a section of America&#8217;s forces moved, eager, cheering.  Lucy appeared on a nearby rooftop.  Liberty walked casually past a few buildings, and by the time she got that far, Verona and Avery had showed up too.</p>
<p>Avery jumped down to the road.</p>
<p>The people who&#8217;d drank the alcohol and eaten the pills were acting up now.  Getting loud, agitated.</p>
<p>Someone was making one of them vomit, shoving fingers down their throat.  Not the thing to do.  Once they started, they didn&#8217;t stop.</p>
<p>In quantities past normal human limits.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s shout to her sister was drowned out.  She looked annoyed at the commotion.  Some goblins were pointing and laughing.  Practitioners were getting mad at the ones who were freaking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kids&#8217;ll get mad you&#8217;re doing war crimes again,&#8221; Gashwad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s not a war crime, is it really worth doing?&#8221; Biscuit asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty stopped in her tracks, about thirty Liberty-paces away from the chaos, commotion, and America&#8217;s horde of goblins.</p>
<p>She crossed the street, going to Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; America shouted, louder than before, trying to cut past the noise.  The other goblins shut up, at least.  Mostly.</p>
<p>Liberty turned her head but didn&#8217;t stop walking.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck are you doing?  We have a pact!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your turn to do what I want this time, then,&#8221; Liberty replied.  &#8220;Stop this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way.  What&#8217;s dad going to think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty gave her sister a long, sad look.  Then went to Avery.</p>
<p>She hugged Avery, tight, and the two of them talked for a short while like that.</p>
<p>Biscuit craned her head, looking for America in the throng.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t look happy.  Devastated even.  Like she was a cute goblin who&#8217;d been called uncute.</p>
<p>One guy was throwing down, blacked out, knocking people out, shouting out about who he liked, who he didn&#8217;t.  It took four people to manage him.  A guy was shitting a geyser and vomiting the same, and the fountain coming out his butt wasn&#8217;t enough to get past the pants, exactly, but it produced a foul puddle, and the puddle expanded out enough that America stepped back and away from it.</p>
<p>And once she stepped away, she kept going that direction, turning and walking away.</p>
<p>Leaving the goblins of her group confused and very unhyped, or distracted by the chaos.</p>
<p>Some started to move in Liberty&#8217;s direction, but they got mobbed by others.</p>
<p>More chaos.</p>
<p>While they were in disarray, Avery Kelly and Liberty stood together, watching as the groups from Kennet below closed the distance.</p>

<hr />
<p>Lucy couldn&#8217;t get her head away from her fight with Logan, years ago.  It was a weird thing to dwell on, but it kept poking at her subconscious, her thoughts turning back to it.  She would have thought it was Charles&#8217; doing, somehow, but she knew herself too well to accept that.  And she knew part of the reason for it.</p>
<p>The same Logan that was in her class now had been in her class most years and for whatever reason (she knew the reason) he&#8217;d picked her to pick on, her to go after, her to make jokes about, constantly.  He was the class clown, friend of the various guys that mattered for most years, like George, Amadeus, and the donkeys.</p>
<p>When the music teacher had been motioning for them to start and he&#8217;d blown on his recorder too early, she&#8217;d asked &#8220;What note was that?&#8221; and he&#8217;d responded &#8220;a Logan note.&#8221;  The class had laughed.  He&#8217;d joked once that Amadeus looked Asian when he laughed, with the way his eyes squinted together, which had made Amadeus laugh, which had gotten the entire class laughing in a loop that had people falling out of their seats, or pretending to.</p>
<p>Most recently, he&#8217;d made a big deal about getting Pam in the spin the bottle game back at the end of semester party.  That hadn&#8217;t gotten as many laughs.  Lucy had stood up for Pam, best she could, because she&#8217;d been there.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t gotten laughs going after Lucy either, but nobody had stood up for her, except Verona, and Verona hadn&#8217;t been as on the ball back then.  Other things going on.</p>
<p><em>Who farted?  Because Lucy has a look on her face like someone farted.  </em>Only a few laughs.  So he&#8217;d taken another tack, repeating it.  Trying to make it a running joke, to get a few more laughs each time.  Refuge in audacity.  Days later?  <em>Still got that look on your face.  Oh, are you trying to get out ahead of the game, with she who smelt it dealt it?  Ha ha ha.</em></p>
<p>Verona was bringing water over to the parents.  She was using those damn reusable, biodegradable water bottles.  Lucy&#8217;s mom had noticed, remembering the call with Verona&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p><em>You look like shit</em>, Logan had told Lucy, unprompted.  He&#8217;d said it a few times.  Not usually with more than a few loyal friends around, and even then he hadn&#8217;t gotten much of a <em>laugh</em>.  He&#8217;d tried that one on a few times.  Really fucking original there, Logan.</p>
<p>Lucy rubbed at her arm.  She felt so uncomfortable in the top she was wearing.  Another thrift-shop loaner from Verona.  It was nice-ish, but it felt like a skin that wasn&#8217;t her own.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t quite remember what had provoked the fight &#8211; sometimes she did, but whenever she did, it kind of got overriden in her memory space with the fight itself.  When she&#8217;d called him out on it, when she&#8217;d <em>finally</em> lost patience, he&#8217;d asked her if she wanted to fight, and she&#8217;d said yes.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d learned a few lessons in that day.  That being outraged and being <em>right</em> didn&#8217;t equate to some special reservoir of strength.  Not like in the cartoons and movies.  There had been nothing satisfying about it.  Both of them had just come out of it looking&#8230; worse.  It had been a hair-pulling, clothes-pulling, sniveling, awkward-grunt exchange, the occasional punch, feeling like she hurt her own hand more than she did anything to him.  They&#8217;d wrestled to the ground, and once he&#8217;d realized he could kick at her leg and get her pants to ride down, he&#8217;d tried to pants her that way, scraping her calf with the side of his shoe over and over again.</p>
<p>The way her head had been back then chased her.  It wasn&#8217;t even the only thing, but she remembered trying to think coherently and pull herself together in the middle of the fight, and getting <em>panic</em> instead.  Panic because her arms weren&#8217;t free to hike her pants back up, because she was so certain every mistake she was making would be its own source of running jokes against her, because she wanted him to stop and he <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em>.  All that, and, more a feeling that she&#8217;d understood thinking about things later than a thought she&#8217;d had then, but still a huge part of it: if she couldn&#8217;t stop him here, fighting with all she had, what the hell could she do against all the rest of it?</p>
<p>Logan existed in a space where he could pull that shit and get away with it.  But Lucy had tried being nice.  That was the thing.  When she found herself wondering if the way people treated her was because of the way she held herself, criticized things that needed criticizing, and refused to take any shit, she had a response.  <em>She had tried</em>.  She had put in her years, she&#8217;d worn shirts with flowers on them, she&#8217;d smiled a lot, she&#8217;d been nice, she&#8217;d been supportive, she&#8217;d gotten anxious about birthday gifts bought for classmates, back in the days when <em>everyone</em> got invited to a birthday, because she wanted to do well.  She&#8217;d been Pamela O&#8217;Neill, Avery&#8217;s original crush, with only nice things to say about others.</p>
<p>It hadn&#8217;t mattered.  The only person backing her up back then, picking her up off the ground, looking her straight in the eye, while Logan talked shit in the background?  Verona.  Even Pam hadn&#8217;t had any words of support, and Pam had- it felt like Pam really should&#8217;ve said something.  Logan had picked on Pam too.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d tried to change things and then it had all been worse.</p>
<p>Lucy felt now like she&#8217;d felt then.  She&#8217;d cried, her clothes felt wrong, she hadn&#8217;t been able to get this asshole to budge, acting from the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done?&#8221; Charles asked.</p>
<p>Verona sat on the armrest, passing Lucy some water.  With friends on either side of her, Lucy put the bottle between her thighs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  I guess,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;re done hydrating, would you be open to a short walk?  It would help us both,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll leave, loop around after a short while, and return here so you can finish your claim, Verona.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona looked over at Avery, then down at Lucy, who was in the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it allows me to illustrate certain points, and it will reframe certain things in the context of Kennet and what we&#8217;ve all been doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy sighed.  She grabbed the bottle, took a big drink of water, and then put it down on the floor by the chair.  She remained where she was, leaning forward, elbows on her knees, glaring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a yes?&#8221; Charles asked.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced at her mom, then at Avery&#8217;s parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it dangerous?&#8221; Kelsey asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll protect us.  But we shouldn&#8217;t run the risk of running into many of the invaders,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;Verona?  Would you have the door lead us to Kennet below?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah.  They&#8217;d kind of skimmed Kennet below with the parents.  Broad strokes were there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Door&#8217;s open,&#8221; Verona said, standing up.  Avery went to the front hall, grabbing her bag as she did, stepping around the bottle Lucy had put down, putting her own down by the wall, there.</p>
<p>Lucy got up.  Her mom kind of intercepted her as they both reached the front hall at the same time, giving her a little hug.  They were blocking Charles and Lucy didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Lucy remained very conscious of the necklace, and the unfamiliar black sweater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Kennet below?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Charles passed through the doorway, the last of them to leave the Demesne, but where they&#8217;d stopped, he kept walking, toward Downtown.  It was night out, and the streetlights of this residential patch had a different hue, with the smoke from the factories in the air.  &#8220;Before I complimented Miss on her ability to find such exceptional young children to be Kennet&#8217;s practitioners, Avery and Verona were on the money about my intentions.  If Lucy had spoken up as well, I would have been dumbstruck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t deserve me speaking up about your plan,&#8221; Lucy said.  That sounded sullen.  It felt sullen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping you&#8217;d bring it up nonetheless.  For the benefit of everyone else here.  I know you&#8217;ve penned the question in your notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been spying on an underage girl?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than you&#8217;re spying on someone&#8217;s home when you look at a satellite picture of their town.  I have a different kind of awareness, mostly around certain words and actions, as they pertain to practice.  The girls know.  They took their turns at being the Carmine, very briefly, to try to unravel the conspiracy, to try to catch me, Maricica, Edith, and the others.  The question, Lucy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you please go fuck yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one you penned in your notebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy sighed again.  &#8220;Why make Kennet below?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a symptom of the knot,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;By tying the rule about travel to you to Kennet, you interrupt and turn aside spiritual flows.  But on the day you used Yalda and the hundreds of other people you murdered with the Choir to kill John, you did it really deliberately.  The Arena was trashed, and you made it- you pushed it into the reflection in the puddles.  Put the intact Arena back in Kennet above.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were in a position to see the Arena, though trees blocked part of the view.  It looked like there was a big party going on in the parking lot.  The building was <em>still</em> burning, still smoking.  Maybe it would as long as Kennet below lasted.</p>
<p>There was a naked man at the top of what looked like a twenty-foot wooden two-by-four, with the bottom of the wooden beam in a burning trash can that apparently had other stuff welded to it to keep it from tipping over.  He seemed to be trying to keep balanced so that the beam wouldn&#8217;t tip over or send him falling to the pavement below.  People around him were shouting, and Lucy&#8217;s earring could pick up the words.  Some had sharp sticks, and others were offering to catch him if he made deals with them.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what were you doing?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Why do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of eight or nine year old kids emerged from the shadows.  The biggest girl had a white bandage across her nose, a lit cigarette in her mouth.  All had knives, and all of them looked like they wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to use them.</p>
<p>Lucy wasn&#8217;t sure if it was because Charles had so much presence or if it was because they recognized her and Verona, but one girl pushed on the arm of the lead girl, whispering.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Let&#8217;s skip this one.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The leader listened, hesitating a second, as if ego kept her rooted and she had to tear free of those roots.  One little boy lingered even longer, but when his buddies were gone, he spat on the road and then hurried after.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve written it in your notes.  Others have said it outright.  This is, in a sense, what humanity once was.  Before the Seal.  On the one hand, they are less literate, fiercer, tribalist.  But the Seal doesn&#8217;t only empower.  It constrains, limits.  Back in early history, there was more room for the exceptional to emerge on their own.  And there was room for those individuals to grapple with whatever aspects of the practice they needed.  Before it was <em>practice</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so I can pin down a timeline, what kind of <em>before</em> was this?&#8221; Connor asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bronze age, I&#8217;m guessing?&#8221; Verona replied.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bronze age,&#8221; Charles confirmed.  &#8220;Before even the written word was easily spread.  Information spread by way of word of mouth and by stories, and we all know how much a single message can mutate, if passed through enough mouths.  It was all <em>mutable</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Connor replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a return to that.  Some differences.  A finger rests on the scales.  But&#8230; let&#8217;s take someone for example, like Suze,&#8221; he said, indicating a young woman sitting in the doorway of an apartment building, pulled in tight against the door, knees to her chest, arms folded, head leaning sideways against the wood.  She had long brown hair.  The woman didn&#8217;t seem to notice they were talking about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about her?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother spent nearly every waking minute of the day fawning over Suze&#8217;s brother, how strong he was, how smart, how fierce.  Constant.  He could do no wrong in her eyes, and if he wanted something, his mother would go to any lengths to give it to him.  Including theft and muggings.  Including meeting up with a man who disgusted her, who had money.  Including stealing from Suze, who got the scraps of what her brother had, taking all the money Suze had saved up to get a place elsewhere to give her brother a very expensive set of headphones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You put this in motion,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;You&#8217;re responsible for that unhappiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that you could find in any town.  There is favoritism and there are parents with blinders on in nearly every neighborhood, even, it&#8217;s only a matter of degrees.  This is a distorted reflection of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t really change what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I explain the reason I put it into motion?&#8221; Charles asked.</p>
<p>Lucy shrugged.  &#8220;Your explanations leave a lot to be desired.&#8221;</p>
<p>He met her eyes briefly, then looked back to Suze.  &#8220;Suze, hungry, tired, frustrated, and lonely, verbally and financially abused by her family, maddened by the minute-by-minute worship of her brother, made to work and give over her pay as rent to her mother, who spent it on her brother, she snapped, though &#8216;snap&#8217; does imply something immediate.  She took ten minutes to boil water on the stove with a full bag of sugar inside, and half a bottle of household cleaner.  Then she threw it at her brother.  The sugar made into a kind of tar, and the cleaner made the resulting scarring worse.  Her brother&#8217;s upper body and her mother&#8217;s hands were affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point of this?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.  &#8220;Telling these children a horror story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is that Suze, after being forced to run away, is pursued and stalked by her mother.  It&#8217;s a game of cat and mouse, with Suze attempting to sneak home and get past her brother to retrieve her things, her mother alternating between a night and day hunt for Suze and care of Suze&#8217;s brother.  One small dynamic at play here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Failing to see the point,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suze can&#8217;t sleep.  Her mother hires thugs to look for her, or will appear wherever Suze has taken to resting.  She has to look out for opportunities, patterns, searches the trash in case her things are thrown out.  She doesn&#8217;t have much, and she badly wants to hold onto that little amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona reached into her bag, and pulled out papers.  She sorted through them, then left their group, approaching the twenty-ish year old woman in the doorway.</p>
<p>Suze stirred as Verona approached, grabbing the door handle to pull herself to a standing position, opening the door, and entering the apartment complex as almost one motion.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.  I&#8217;m the third witch of Kennet.  Not a threat.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Suze remained there, edge of the door pressed against the middle of her chest and stomach, ready to slip through.  Her head moved weird- like she was fighting to avoid falling asleep, even as alarm churned through her.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Pass.  To enter Kennet found.  Wear a mask.  You can&#8217;t really hurt anyone, but&#8230; be good.  You&#8217;ll be able to sleep, no threat.  It&#8217;ll let you get your head sharp.  If you can&#8217;t find a way to get your stuff, talk to me.  I&#8217;ll be around tomorrow afternoon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Verona inched forward.  The moment the paper was close enough to grab, Suze took it, then disappeared inside, slamming the door.</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s earring let her catch the running footsteps, the slam of the door on the far side of the building, as Suze escaped out the back.</p>
<p>Verona came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; Charles said, &#8220;is a large part of why I wanted to talk to you.  We&#8217;re at odds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I finish what I was saying?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Suze was on her way to becoming something special.  Every time she&#8217;s alerted and runs, the stress response is longer lasting, it gives her a little more for more time.  She&#8217;s already ceased to sleep, but as she twisted and knotted internally, she was gradually approaching a state where she&#8217;ll be running on a stress high every minute of the day&#8230; and even finding and entering a special second tier that exists when she&#8217;s always on the alert and something calls for a special stress response.  Eventually, if she lived and continued on that course, there would be a third.  In the process, she taps into something visceral.  If she goes to the right places, deals with the right goblins, the right bogeymen, if she draws in spirits, then she&#8217;ll adapt faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds horrible,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;Constant stress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it empowers her.  It gives her a special set of tools to approach the world.  Her mother has the potential for the same kind of growth.  So does her brother.  So does the young girl who was leading the small gang that briefly stepped into the road ahead of us.  So does the man behind the counter back there.  Mallory, Bracken, Bag, they had or have the potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of your plan?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced around.  There were people who were looking at them, all around them.  They stood in the middle of the road, which wasn&#8217;t a big deal because there wasn&#8217;t much traffic, and they were the center of attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t only about practitioners and Others,&#8221; Charles explained.  &#8220;If it were only about making some big, problematic Others to take over this region, my efforts wouldn&#8217;t amount to much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy kept looking around.  &#8220;You&#8217;re going to do it elsewhere?  This?  You&#8217;re going to do it in all the Lordships&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She trailed off, ready to make it a question at the last second if Charles gave any indication she was off tack.  But she was pretty sure-</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the intention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look or sound like a very nice place,&#8221; Kelsey said.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the upside, it doesn&#8217;t look like most of the stores close mid-afternoon,&#8221; Connor joked.</p>
<p>Kelsey gave him a half smile, as if she wanted to acknowledge the joke, then she looked at Avery.  &#8220;You girls have been here a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those guys more than me,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Most of this has sprung up while I was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want to spread this out?&#8221; Kelsey asked Charles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each Lordship its own instance, with its own ideas and rules.  Again, if it was as simple as a few puzzling monsters, someone like Marie Durocher could storm in, with enough brute power.  Or a clever mind could unravel the trap.  But I&#8217;ve looked over Wye Belanger&#8217;s shoulders, as he looked at the future.  I&#8217;ve kept an ear out for the ongoing discussions between the new Lords and people outside.  Between Raymond Sunshine and people around the world.  I know how this will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting kind of tired of the prophecies,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>Charles smiled a bit, but it was a smile turned surly by the deep lines in his forehead and face.  &#8220;I used to be friends with Alexander.  I know the feeling.  But I&#8217;ll tell you now, there will be an initial reprisal, without enough information.  Favors called in.  Aimed at me.  It&#8217;ll happen over the next few weeks and months.  Some will succeed, others will fail, but the ones they remove will be replaced soon enough, as sleeping Others rouse and act.  Then they&#8217;ll notice the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles extended a hand, red hair on the back of it, dark lines in the grooves and marking out the lines, like he&#8217;d gotten ink on it and only rubbed the surface level of it off.  Toward the people on the street.</p>
<p>One of those people, an old woman, cupped a breast that drooped to her pelvis, and gave him the finger with a trembling hand.  The look on her face made it look like she could spit bile and venom.  Maybe she could, if she was out at night and nobody was really bothering her.</p>
<p>Lucy hoped the Oldbodies weren&#8217;t adding more people to their ranks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you plan to fill the province with enough of these people to&#8230; what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the people from the Lighthouse,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the people Larry Bristow sent to Kennet.  Clementine, Daniel, Sharon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t in the notes,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in another book,&#8221; Lucy replied, quiet.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you that later.  They&#8217;re&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re wrecking balls.  They disrupt what practitioners build.  They fight Others.  Toadswallow has mentioned the cat lady?  The boy with the improvised traps, after he glimpsed a goblin?  The-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mentioned the cat lady,&#8221; Lucy interrupted.  &#8220;Bit of a surprise obstacle for any goblins up to mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a target, if they want to do something silly,&#8221; Verona added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same idea.  Wrecking balls and pitfalls.  I like to see that kind of Awareness as the world straining, <em>fighting</em>-&#8221; he clenched a fist for emphasis.  &#8220;-<em>fighting, </em>climbing that wall that is the Seal, to get what it needs to the other side.  Antibodies.  A natural response.  A few humans, as they used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antibodies.  Humans like they were in the bronze age.  Aware all over the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;To what?  Slow them down?  Mess them up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be wary, after the first few traps.  Then they&#8217;ll catch first wind of the rise of this population of Aware and Knotted.  Hesitation becomes a halt.  A halt becomes a hiatus.  A hiatus becomes a question.  What&#8217;s the benefit?  What do they gain by trying?  A tract of wilderness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toronto?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;That was apparently a big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say someone retakes Toronto.  What do they gain, except problems?  New problematic Others, sometimes one a month, sometimes two a week, all looking to be Lords, pulled there like&#8230; like gravity drawing drops of blood to the lowest point in a bowl.  And in the population, countless troublesome people mingling with the population, with abilities and resistances that put them contrary to conventional practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And everyone else?&#8221; Kelsey asked.  &#8220;People like <em>this, </em>who&#8217;d throw boiling water on their brother out of resentment?  Children with knives and cigarettes?  What happens to the Ontario we know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of Ontario, part of Manitoba.  Different borders,&#8221; Charles replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever.  What happens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The news media will find ways to explain it away.  A failure in the police, a question of leadership, employment levels, costs of living.  Some explanation for riots, insurgency, rising crime rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what she&#8217;s asking,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;How many people get hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many.  But the alternative is worse.  The alternative where the Belangers wound, maim, and use omens to spy, even knowing those omens may cause bad things to happen.  Like Melissa Oakham falling and snapping her foot off.  An alternative where Bristow enslaves and keeps people, <em>uses</em> them-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like you&#8217;re doing with the Aware?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t enslave or keep them.  They&#8217;re free to do as they wish, and enough of them will wish to get in the way or push back that it&#8217;ll work.  What I&#8217;m saying-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if we&#8217;re done hearing what you&#8217;re saying?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Will you change your mind?  Is there anything I can say that&#8217;ll change your mind?  Verona?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; Verona murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery?  Anything?  Charles, is there anything Avery can say or offer that&#8217;ll change your plans here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already underway,&#8221; the Carmine Exile told her.  His breath fogged in the cool evening air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s very fair that you&#8217;re pushing all of this expecting us to come meet you in a compromise, when you&#8217;re not really budging,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is nice of you to tell us your evil plan, though,&#8221; Verona said, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not evil,&#8221; Charles replied, looking momentarily startled as he said it.  His voice wasn&#8217;t a growl, but it still had that burr of a growl to it that came from years and years of being sick, of being tired, of being Forsworn.  &#8220;It&#8217;s desperate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it can be both of those,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me not to mince words.  So I won&#8217;t.  What Verona just did is hurting both you and it&#8217;s getting in my way.  Musser will return.  Kennet will face other threats.  Suze was on her way to becoming someone who could and would push back, who would trip up conventional practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suze was a person and it sounds like she was having a hell of a bad time,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Not saying she should have done what she did, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy folded her arms.  &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of a dynamic down here.  No law except how much you can defend yourself, everyone out for themselves, freedom.  Minimal support, unless someone sees you&#8217;re in trouble and offers help.  Which is usually us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom put a hand on her shoulder, rubbing, and did the same for Verona.  But if she was proud, she was concerned enough for that emotion to override the look of pride in her expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You two have, anyway,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she was and is a person,&#8221; Avery said, looking up at Charles.  &#8220;Franky Reiber is a person, and she- is she going to be okay, when you use her to make a trap?  After she or her goat or whatever you&#8217;re doing makes her the focus of Thunder Bay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the city of Peterborough, there is a practitioner with the family name Allaire.  He&#8217;s a community organizer in Stanground, the only positive voice some youth have heard in their lives.  He does cleanup events every other weekend, picking up trash, maintains a group of twenty teenagers who go with him on weekends to various charity services, another ten who show up only sometimes.  But sometimes he&#8217;ll let them know there&#8217;s a tough stint in an old folks home, or something unpleasant, and instead he&#8217;ll take them to waterparks, or skating.  He rewards them with pizza, shawarma, burgers.  For some, again, it&#8217;s all they get.  Some of the funds for those trips and food come from community donations, some places let him and the kids eat for free once a month.  But mostly he pays out of pocket.  Family money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great,&#8221; Kelsey said.  &#8220;But?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He recently took an apprentice.  One promising young lady who attended every weekend, because she was homeless.  She showered at school, had a teacher do her laundry.  She was resourceful, smart, eager, and was working with plans to go to university in two years.  She was his thirteenth apprentice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to the other twelve?&#8221; Connor asked.</p>
<p>Charles&#8217; voice took on that growl again.  &#8220;The same thing that happened to the thirteenth.  He forswore them all.  And he keeps them.  He gives them sanctuary knowing if they ever leave they&#8217;ll have to return before long, because what the world will do to a forsworn person is worse than being his servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the Seal prevent that?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;You take on responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should, and he should.  Just as Musser can say he&#8217;s won enough times he should be able to cry precedent and win this time, skip the trivial parts, Mr. Allaire claims he and his family have the right, because that&#8217;s their pattern.  His mother did it before him, and his son and daughter will do it after him.  Pillars of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy gripped the sleeve of her sweater.  &#8220;So because bad things are happening, that excuses-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it all,&#8221; Charles replied.  His eyes were sad.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve been Carmine, even if it was only for a short time.  Thirteen individuals, four more that were Forsworn by the mother.  Allaire&#8217;s daughter did the Awakening ritual last year and has plans to paint a scenario, where she&#8217;ll &#8216;accidentally&#8217;, quote unquote, reveal magic to a classmate.  She aims to lure her in with that, then awaken her, then forswear her, and she&#8217;ll have a handmaid for life.  Seth Belanger, you know him, forsworn by his guardian.  Another man is out there, who was forsworn by Alexander.  A friend sometimes, an enemy at other times.  He was an enemy at the wrong time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are forsworn, okay,&#8221; Lucy said, &#8220;but-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me finish.  Because many of these people, they aren&#8217;t seen.  They aren&#8217;t recognized.  A Lord took over Peterborough just before Musser came here.  They shook Allaire&#8217;s hand and agreed to work with him, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll ever realize on their own, but if they do, I&#8217;m not confident they&#8217;ll care enough to act on it.  Thirteen under Allaire.  Four still alive, Forsworn by his departed mother.  One, soon to be, under the child.  Seth Belanger.  Griffin Lytle, forsworn by Alexander, far worse off than I ever was, he&#8217;s in the deep woods, barely holding on to humanity.  There are five more, and those are just the ones who&#8217;ve survived this long.  Joel Richardson, Lenard Lily, Yiyun Jen, Josef Miller, Helen Kim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;That&#8217;s terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stand where I stand, and these people aren&#8217;t really in my jurisdiction.  The other Judges are meant to keep an eye on them, for varying reasons.  I&#8217;m meant to oversee the act of Forswearing.  But I still see them.  I see what&#8217;s in the region, and I can and do the equivalent of looking them in the eye, every moment.  I could change the subject away from Forswearing and tell you of the horrible things practitioners are doing without stopping until Christmas comes.  Some of those practitioners are in this town.  Others are like Allaire, too small to matter, but dangerous enough to ruin lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy felt her mom&#8217;s hand tighten on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then fix that,&#8221; Lucy told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, but I have a lot to do before I can.  I won&#8217;t outline that part of my so-called evil plan to you, not here and not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s shitty?&#8221; Lucy pressed him.  She unfolded her arms.  &#8220;Because it&#8217;s so bad you&#8217;d spoil your argument?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re clearly against me.  If you won&#8217;t accept what I&#8217;m doing, I have to worry you&#8217;ll get in the way of me helping those forsworn, even if it means sealing their fates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not us,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;I mean, I&#8217;m way less empathetic than these guys, and I don&#8217;t see myself doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;re more empathetic than you think,</em> Lucy thought.  &#8220;Kind of surprised you haven&#8217;t done it already, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment,&#8221; Charles said.  He let out a heavy sigh.  &#8220;I&#8217;m desperate.  This has to change.  I hoped I could approach you, and call for another truce.  Keep Kennet above, Kennet below, and your Kennet found separate.  Don&#8217;t rescue the people here.  Let them find their own strength.  Then if they&#8217;re inclined, which many are, let them turn that strength against our mutual enemies.  For Griffin Lytle, it&#8217;s a question of life or death.  If you say no, if you refuse, Griffin dies as a result.  For Yiyun Jen, depending on her fortune, it might be the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Connor said.  &#8220;You&#8217;re threatening to kill?  And you&#8217;re using that-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not threatening to kill.  There are things I can do and there are things I cannot.  I have certain reserves of power, I have certain ways of replenishing it.  If you interfere now, you slow me down, but you don&#8217;t stop me.  Griffin dies, Musser gets a small edge, and then I carry on doing what I was doing.  That&#8217;s the only meaningful decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like it&#8217;s on you, not us, and you&#8217;re an asshole for trying to make it our problem,&#8221; Lucy told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Forsworn are near and dear to my heart.  I don&#8217;t pretend to be a good person.  I may only care because I was Forsworn, but I care.  I&#8217;m selfish and I&#8217;m desperate.  With how much this matters to me, if there was another way, I would find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Running on empty, Chuck?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a lot to do and a careful balance to strike to get there.  Now, if you don&#8217;t get out of my way, then people who don&#8217;t deserve it, and perhaps some that do, they&#8217;ll suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck are you putting on these kids&#8217; shoulders?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reality.  As Lucy likes to stress, they&#8217;re teenagers, and that means an unhappy, sometimes unwieldy mess of childhood goofiness and the crushing weight of adult responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for you,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  &#8220;That&#8217;s for me to guide them into.  Trusted teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And untrustworthy ones, and people your daughter will meet on the street, and those she&#8217;ll run into on a first job.  You know that well enough, through Booker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about my brother,&#8221; Lucy said, words coming too fast, with a note of alarm.</p>
<p>Charles raised a hand.  Black in the creases.  Maybe dried blood.  Fingernails a bit too long and uneven.  Motioning for her to ease down.</p>
<p>She fucking eased <em>up</em>, drawing in a breath, ready to go on the offensive.  Being <em>shushed</em>, essentially?  Fuck that.  Especially from fucking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t touch or involve Booker.  Or your mother,&#8221; Charles said, looking aside.  &#8220;No more than they involve themselves, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy didn&#8217;t ease down, even with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Charles said.  He turned and started walking.  &#8220;Matthew is this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;On a routine patrol.  Let&#8217;s get this awkward moment out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you were talking about before,&#8221; Connor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said what I needed to say.  I can&#8217;t see the future, I&#8217;ll have to leave it to you and those girls to decide.  I gave you a concession, letting the Garricks take people away.  I&#8217;ve given Verona time, in case Musser returns.  I&#8217;ve given Avery information about Franky.  I&#8217;m asking for assistance here, for something that serves us both,&#8221; Charles told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we accept this concession now, what&#8217;s to say you won&#8217;t just ask us to make the same concession next time?&#8221; Lucy asked, walking fast to keep up.</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, there shouldn&#8217;t be twenty-five forsworn next time,&#8221; Charles said, without slowing.  His breath fogged around his head.  &#8220;And if there are, they&#8217;ll be a new twenty-five.  I&#8217;d hope you&#8217;re human enough to recognize that those twenty-five will likely need rescuing too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you talking about forswearing people?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I must.  I wouldn&#8217;t stab this metaphorical child in the foot, but I&#8217;d cut the leg off if it&#8217;d save their life,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll act against those who&#8217;d hurt us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure sounds like you&#8217;re planning a lot of amputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you fault me?&#8221; Charles asked, more growl than before.  His back to them, his stride fast and fierce enough to put him ten feet ahead of the group, he raised a hand.</p>
<p>Maricica made her appearance, descending from a nearby rooftop.  She had no wings but didn&#8217;t need them to fly.  Blood splashed up where she touched road, and there hadn&#8217;t been blood pooling there before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; Connor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different religion,&#8221; Maricica said, before turning to smile at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maricica,&#8221; Charles said, not even fazed by her arrival.  &#8220;Where is Edith?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maricica revealed a candle, then blew.  The air ignited, the flame spread, and wax splattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Wax gave form, and flame gave heat while forming into the shape of the spirit.  Big, candle across the shoulders, shorter than it had once been, almost a mirror to Maricica in how she had drippings all over her, but it was white wax and not blood.</p>
<p>Orange, burning eyes glared at Lucy, her friends, and their parents, before the &#8216;flesh&#8217; rose up enough to encapsulate her.  Shoulders drew together, head ducked down, and she contorted into a position inside Edith&#8217;s form.  Wax formed into clothing, or formed clumps that broke off, with clothes beneath where there&#8217;d been skin before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Do your pleas go unheard, Carmine Exile?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Maricica had asked it, smiling, floating with toenail tracing the puddle of blood beneath her, dragging faintly on the road occasionally.  She twisted in the air, belly-up momentarily, then crouching, keeping her head at a level with Charles&#8217;, even though she was far taller and larger than him.  Edith kept pace.  They spoke in low voices.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call them pleas.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Your cogent and heartfelt attempts to sway?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;As Lucy observed, I&#8217;m not about to change my mind, this far in.  It&#8217;s perhaps unfair to expect the same of them.  I hope they do.  I hope they discuss, but I&#8217;ll figure out a way forward either way.  Maybe death is a mercy to Griffin.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;And the other one?  I&#8217;ve let myself forget.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mom touched her shoulder, squeezing.  &#8220;So that&#8217;s-&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy pressed a finger to her lips, and tilted her head.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d missed Charles&#8217; one word response.  Maricica was next to speak.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;My head is full of blood and violence.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better leave as soon as you can manage, without causing a stir.  Her name was Yiyun Jen.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Of course, and of course.  Oh, poor Carmine Exile.  I&#8217;m sorry this hasn&#8217;t gone as you hoped.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  Edith?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;What?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;How are you today?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Worried.  Hopeful.  Matthew will hate this, but&#8230; inroads?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Better you ask Maricica that than ask me.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Edith didn&#8217;t ask Maricica.</p>
<p>Lucy moved her finger away from her lips, then looked up at her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s Edith.  And we&#8217;re going to see Matthew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I didn&#8217;t think Edith would be that&#8230; that was a spectacle.  And everyone acts like it&#8217;s normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those things, yeah,&#8221; Lucy replied, quiet.</p>
<p>She glanced back, saw Avery at the back of the pack for once, talking to her parents, and Verona on her lonesome.</p>
<p>She reached back, grabbed Verona&#8217;s arm, and pulled her forward, to put an arm around Verona&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s nice and warm,&#8221; Verona said.  She was wearing that sweater that exposed her shoulders.  &#8220;Keep it like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to borrow my jacket?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a little big, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Oh man, I want to talk about all this forever, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>The conspirators were ahead.  Just out of earshot.  No longer talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been super lonely, weirdly, with a stream of Foundlings and the occasional annoying practitioner passing through,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Could really do with a sleepover.  I dunno if you&#8217;re up for it, I know it&#8217;s a school night, but if you aren&#8217;t, and if McCauleigh is staying around, maybe I&#8217;ll have her over again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can she?&#8221; Lucy asked her mom.  &#8220;Tomorrow night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like- I feel as if we need to talk,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Except I don&#8217;t know what to say, what to ask.  Maybe I&#8217;ll know by tomorrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed a guy on the sidewalk who had three sets of handcuffs on, plus some stuff at his ankles, and a bike lock extending from the crook of his elbow to the groin area, where the upper leg met the pelvis.  He was inchworming his way forward, huffing.  When he heard them coming, he flipped onto his back, up against the wall, and growled, holding a knife out.  Metal clacked on metal- he had two separate sets of brass knuckles on each hand, with wire extending from them to the cuffs, so he couldn&#8217;t remove them.  It looked like it made holding the knife hard.</p>
<p>A lock like Lucy or anyone in the high school might&#8217;ve used for their lockers, except with a bit more of a metal loop was in his face.  It extended up through the floor of his mouth, through a hole in the tongue, and out the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you need help?&#8221; Avery called out.</p>
<p>He shouted something unintelligible, that might&#8217;ve been slurs and insults, drool and froth at his mouth and at the little hole in the underside of his jaw, working its way down that lock.  He got agitated, swinging the knife at open air, various shackles limiting his range of movements.</p>
<p>Partially to keep up with Charles, partially because the man didn&#8217;t seem to want saving, they left him behind.</p>
<p>There was a group of people all holding candles at a tiny church on one corner &#8211; tiny enough it wasn&#8217;t even that church-y &#8211; more a cross tacked onto a small store with apartments above it.  A pastor with blood on his white collar was holding both hands up like he was under arrest as he preached.  Each palm had an &#8216;x&#8217; carved into it, blood caking the long black sleeves..  Maybe a cross, but the angle was wrong.</p>
<p>The candles burned brighter as Edith passed by.  It made shadows behind the bloody pastor sharp enough to make out, swaying and dancing for a brief moment as the wind passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is scary,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is <em>his</em>,&#8221; Lucy replied.  &#8220;As much as we&#8217;ve tried to make parts of it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as they got to the north end of downtown, Lucy saw the market.  The stalls were mostly closed.  Matthew was there, talking to one of the Bitter Street Witch&#8217;s brothers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Go.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;You sure?  Need me to alert anyone?&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think so.  But go.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew Moss,&#8221; Charles said, as he approached.  His voice carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles Abrams, Carmine Exile.  And company,&#8221; Matthew said, dry, almost disappointed.  &#8220;My night just got worse.  Girls.  Parents.  I hope he hasn&#8217;t convinced you of anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; Lucy replied.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Matthew,&#8221; Edith said.</p>
<p>Matthew glanced at Edith, then looked away.  He kept his voice level.  &#8220;Charles.  You spoiled things with the Garricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve offered the girls a compromise that will let them get the Garricks out.  But the Garricks can&#8217;t be doing business here over the long term.  Not as couriers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change.  He looked at Verona, then Lucy, then Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the Garricks are anxiously waiting.  I&#8217;ll free the others to go where they need to go, but I thought it would be fairest if there are witnesses.  Edith would have to be here, and the girls being here means there&#8217;s more of a balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Witnesses for <em>what</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew, you successfully sought and maintained a Demesne claim.  The house is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It damn well better be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you managed that fight by drawing on a connection.  A longstanding, intricate one.  You shared in something of Edith James, and she drew on her connection to you for strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhh,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the bullshit did she draw on Matthew?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Edith wheeled on her, her eyes burning brighter than before.  &#8220;Mind your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This <em>is</em> our business,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re guardians of Kennet, and Matthew is of Kennet, and yeah, what Lucy asked.  That&#8217;s not how this connection works, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith James drew on an emotional tie to Matthew, for the strength to continue fighting against <em>shit</em> odds.  There are rituals that involve fighting, violence, and sacrifice that are less significant than her fight that night,&#8221; Charles answered.  &#8220;She drew heavily on that tie.  I&#8217;m going to rule as Judge that it fits.  He draws on power from the Doom, which was supplied by her, she draws on heart, a fervent, sustained desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew snorted his nose loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not funny,&#8221; Edith told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an ass, Charles, and this is a sham,&#8221; Matthew said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve undergone one binding ritual, marriage.  A second point of reference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve got a third.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been living together for a time, in close proximity.  All three of those things are tied to the property claimed as a Demesne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sounds like common law marriage,&#8221; Connor spoke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Common law familiarship, let&#8217;s call it,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;Sui iuris, by habit and repute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew snorted again.  &#8220;Fuck you.   No words were said, no deals made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But each party offered and gave to the others, and each has an inextricable relationship to the property,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s done, Matthew.  If you wish to appeal, seek one of the other Judges.  Or me, if you wish, but I&#8217;ll be busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that for all intents and purposes, as far as this Demesne is considered, and only for that purpose, Edith James is effectively Matthew Moss&#8217;s familiar,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;With all rights he has, with a small share of the influence.  It&#8217;s customary that the familiar gets space of her own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew didn&#8217;t reply, his expression hard.</p>
<p><em>This is gross.  This is gross.  This is gross</em>, Lucy thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk, okay?&#8221; Edith said.  &#8220;Tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will we?&#8221; Matthew asked, voice low.  He had a thumb hooked into his pocket and the hand clenched into a fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;A compromise?  It&#8217;s fine if you want to put me in the basement, knowing it&#8217;s where you kept me prisoner-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s complicated,&#8221; Verona murmured, to Lucy&#8217;s mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;-But we&#8217;ll cross paths.  There has to be some conversation eventually, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew looked off to one side.  &#8220;Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221; Charles asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What proportion is usually given to the familiar?  Percentage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One half to one sixth.  And she&#8217;d have the run of the space between, to access that subspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One sixth?&#8221; Matthew asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll insist you give her something, one sixth should be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make it sound like we&#8217;re pulling your teeth out,&#8221; Edith told Matthew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please shut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can talk after, like we were doing before.  My family&#8217;s been asking questions-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send them a card at Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should work out a system with the bills, I know you work and I don&#8217;t, but we still have the old joint account-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care.  This isn&#8217;t your way to reconciling, Edith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t- maybe it&#8217;s not possible to reconcile, but it was <em>minutes</em> out of the entire time we were together.  Out of ten good years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years tainted by what happened in those minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I supposed to do, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I offer you half to shut up for a month?&#8221; Matthew asked.  &#8220;We can consider that our first interaction of this new dynamic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;No matter how bad this is, don&#8217;t concede.  Don&#8217;t give her space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interfere!&#8221; Edith raised her voice, eyes flaring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at my daughter,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said, hand at Lucy&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>A shaking hand.  Lucy put hers over her mom&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget the space.  Don&#8217;t give her that step forward,&#8221; Avery said, insistent.  &#8220;A short term gain for a lifelong loss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to be enemies?&#8221; Edith asked them.</p>
<p>Verona laughed.</p>
<p>Charles intervened, stepping between them, eyes on the ground.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sure this argument could go on for some time.  But I should get these girls to their Demesne claim and the Garricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So responsible,&#8221; Maricica said, smiling.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Responsible for a lot,&#8221;</em> Lucy muttered to herself.</p>
<p>Charles turned.  &#8220;Edith?  I did my part for our arrangement.  At least for this sub-part.  Find me after if you need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to be here for a long time.  This is going to be a process,&#8221; Edith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew?&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s set in stone.  To go against this would be to go against karma.  You&#8217;d spark off your own Doom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine that,&#8221; Matthew said, his voice so soft as to be inaudible.  &#8220;I thought we were friends, once.  As much as was possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends.  Occasionally using me as a carrying case for curses, ailments&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could&#8217;ve said no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was made clear, I had a debt to pay, for the sanctuary I was given.  It doesn&#8217;t matter.  There&#8217;s enough happening tonight.  We should talk again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m convinced we&#8217;re going to, whether I like it or not,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;Edith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have your key?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.  &#8220;I am excited.  I know my influence won&#8217;t be close to yours, but&#8230; tonight&#8217;s a new night, right?  Fresh start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poisoned me, Edith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>Edith went to the front door, unlocking it.</p>
<p>The door made it about a quarter inch before banging into something.</p>
<p>Edith turned to look at Matthew.  &#8220;A barricade?  Cute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a barricade.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went around the front of the house to the window, where the curtains were drawn.  She moved a hand, and ignited the curtains.</p>
<p>The moment they&#8217;d burned up to the curtain rod, she motioned again.  The fire extinguished as fast as it had appeared.</p>
<p>Inside it was dark.  But it was-</p>
<p>Edith produced a light.  It didn&#8217;t help all that much- windows weren&#8217;t so great to look through if you were on the side with the light source.</p>
<p>-dark but textured.</p>
<p>Edith backed up, then looked at a second floor window.  She burned that curtain and the sheer drapes too, then extinguished that fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother bought us those drapes,&#8221; Matthew said, with a bit of humor in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <em>is</em> that!?&#8221; Edith asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slate,&#8221; Matthew said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slate?  Stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew nodded.  &#8220;I kind of like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;d filled the house.  One block of smooth black stone with rough edges, extending through floor, possibly into the basement.  If there was any space left inside, it was a half-inch gap between the stone and the walls or the stone and the windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solid all the way through?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.  Enlisted goblins to help, had them ferry it in, stack it, I made it all into one piece, then expanded it out.  I think facing down as many claims as I did really got the spirits cooperating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Really nice to hear.  I hope it works the same way with mine, and all the Foundlings.  They&#8217;re great, they&#8217;re fun, it&#8217;s cool, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith went back around to the front door, and pressed her hand against it.  She turned her head.  &#8220;Good?  Cool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d taken the half instead, to shut up,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;Amounts to pretty much the same thing.  One sixth of nothing?  Half of nothing?  Or there are gaps.  I guess you could squeeze some spirit and wax in there, but it wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable.  You can have one sixth of that space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My things?&#8221; Edith asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;d buy a pickaxe, but I imagine that&#8217;s where you&#8217;d start.  Could even be fun.  Bit of archeology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith dropped to her knees, hands pressed against the slate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your things?&#8221; Verona asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moved out a while ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of it I&#8217;ll miss.  But whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do I go?&#8221; Edith asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not my problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith turned.  &#8220;Charles, this is against what you told him to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done before any ruling was handed down,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;I made sure to ask what proportion might be fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith climbed to her feet, then went back to the door momentarily, as if to verify it was still there.  &#8220;Charles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twist the ruling.  There have to be interpretations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dangerous words, with a dangerous karmic weight to them.  Asking a Judge to cheat on your behalf?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk <em>after</em>.  I want resolution now.  Tonight I was supposed to get Matthew back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew scoffed.</p>
<p>With the brightness of Edith&#8217;s eyes as she turned toward Matthew, Lucy thought for a second she was attacking him.</p>
<p>White wax tears rolled down her cheeks.  The tips of her eyelashes had an orange spark to them, like tiny flames.  &#8220;Maricica.  You said I&#8217;d have him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you did.  For a little while.  You had him in your house, your company, at your mercy, even.  But I didn&#8217;t say you&#8217;d get to keep him.  That&#8217;s up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith looked at everyone present, as if for help.</p>
<p>Lucy made sure to have a good glare on her face for when Edith looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it?  Fuck me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said we can talk,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that talk get me Matthew back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it does.  But you might&#8217;ve never really had him for more than a few months, in all honesty.  But we&#8217;ll talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith,&#8221; Matthew said.</p>
<p>She turned toward him.  Lucy could see the hint of hope in Edith&#8217;s eyes, for just that one second.  It stirred up ugly feelings.  It made her think a bit about that useless fight against Logan.  A fight that had left her feeling more like a pig picking herself out of the mud than someone victorious or vindicated.</p>
<p>Edith was in that mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you need cab fare to get to your family?  I can make the call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In another town?  Trying to get rid of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just offering,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I think your wallet and phone were inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith turned to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; Edith asked.  She sounded lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you tell your family you&#8217;re kicked out because you poisoned me and manipulated me.  Or lie.  I really don&#8217;t care that much.  Maybe come back, talk to Charles, for direction, altering how you&#8217;re built, take the hurt away, I dunno.  Maybe just stay away, seems easier and better to me, but I&#8217;m biased.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith stared at the house, and the open front door with a black face of rock just inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;That block is staying, as long as I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was and am a broken ghost, spirit instead of a soul, candle instead of an inner light, cobbled together, hidden away inside a broken person,&#8221; Edith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Matthew said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought- I thought I was <em>your</em> broken mess.  I thought I at least had that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Played at being human pretty well, I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fooled me,&#8221; Matthew replied, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this would be it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This <em>is</em> it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran her hand over her head, and wax came away from her hair in peels and flakes.</p>
<p>Lucy still wasn&#8217;t sure if Edith would lash out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, um-&#8221; Edith started, halting with the emotion in her voice.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the money to get a cab.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got his wallet out.  Then he pulled out a whole mess of bills.  Maybe ten twenties.</p>
<p>She took it, then looked down at it.  &#8220;Had all that ready.  You were looking forward to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the house, then back to her.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll call the cab.  Wait at the corner there?  End of the block?  In Kennet above?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing else to say?  No last words?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew didn&#8217;t reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright then.  End of the block, then I&#8217;ll move up to Kennet above when nobody&#8217;s looking.  I&#8217;ll talk to you, Charles,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith walked down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t looking forward to it,&#8221; Matthew said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely makes sense,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I thought you&#8217;d fuck me over,&#8221; Matthew told Charles, finishing the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not your enemy.  I&#8217;m where I need to be.  You&#8217;re where you need to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head.  &#8220;But you got where you are by-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By means,&#8221; Charles interrupted.  &#8220;I <em>know</em>.  Let&#8217;s not rehash this.  The Garricks are waiting and they&#8217;re worried.  Go to them.  Verona?  I&#8217;ll let you go.  Or if you&#8217;d like, I&#8217;ll walk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; Verona suggested.  &#8220;How much more awkward can it be than my best friends&#8217; parents walking in with all my naked mural art on the walls?  And ceiling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come.  No way am I letting you walk off into crimetown in the company of a feral god man without company,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.  She turned to Connor and Kelsey.  &#8220;Can you look after Avery?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelsey nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;Bit of backup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Kelsey said.  &#8220;Your name came up a few times.  It&#8217;ll be good to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery, standing by Connor and Kelsey, met Lucy&#8217;s eyes, as if trying to communicate something with a look.  Lucy wasn&#8217;t sure what, but her mom had a hand at her shoulder, and squeezed, and that made Lucy wonder if her mom had gotten what Lucy hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Avery then looked at Verona, expression unreadable, who stood next to Charles, expression readable: bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish we weren&#8217;t always splitting up,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucy told her.  &#8220;Text us?  Especially if you&#8217;re traveling in the morning.  Or we&#8217;ll reconnect closer to midnight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh,&#8221; Matthew said.  &#8220;Before we split, I got word earlier.  We need to have a council meeting about what&#8217;s going on with the goblins down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.  &#8220;Talk to Louise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sleeping over there, so yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>It felt weird, talking about this with the conspirators close.  A faerie or ex-faerie close.</p>
<p>But like, they knew anyway?  Charles was kind of omniscient.</p>
<p>Maricica was first to leave, going to Edith&#8217;s side, when Edith really looked like she didn&#8217;t want the giant naked blood goddess as company.</p>
<p>Avery went down toward the valley, with Matthew and her parents.  Lucy, her mom, Verona, and Charles walked back toward Verona&#8217;s Demesne.</p>
<p>They walked, and it wasn&#8217;t a walk with a lot of conversation, which was kind of a nice thing.  It would have felt like they were leaving Avery out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five forsworn,&#8221; Verona mused out loud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  You could consider it twenty-four.  Griffin is pretty far gone.  One Other trying to possess him, another trying to transform him, a tug of war with what&#8217;s left of him in the middle.   It&#8217;s not so much my aim to twist your arm as it is to hold onto some hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty horrible fate,&#8221; Verona commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in each case, someone did it to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Costly, has to be,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Charles raised eyebrows, looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember some of the calculus that had to be made, the decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Costly?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bending the interpretations and the rules for twenty-five people, to get them free of being Forsworn.  Takes&#8230; political capital?  Power?  Influence?  Whatever you want to call what you get from being a Judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit more to turn it back on the ones who did it to them, in some cases,&#8221; Charles growled the words.  &#8220;A bit to save Griffin, if he can be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you bankrupting yourself?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting to where you&#8217;re pretty vulnerable, and that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re shy of sharing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is getting to where you should be very careful, Verona Hayward.  I&#8217;ll be honest, some of the Judges are a little sick of your shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying to this girl?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>He put up a hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you raise your hand with the intention of shutting me, my daughter, or either of those other two girls down again, I&#8217;ll make you regret it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put the hand down, still with the presence of a man who didn&#8217;t believe her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we agree to any truce, and we do have to talk to Avery about this, will you get anything you&#8217;ll use against us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might gain something.  I&#8217;ll agree not to use that something against you,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;I want them free, but it&#8217;s hard.  The timing alone- it&#8217;s not good timing now, but-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Griffin?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In another world, if I hadn&#8217;t found Kennet, I&#8217;d be in his shoes.  I&#8217;d hope he&#8217;d do the same for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d hope he&#8217;d kill hundreds?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Threaten children?  Threaten to orphan children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In his shoes?  In the shoes I was wearing at the time?  I wouldn&#8217;t be very picky at all, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which really said it all.</p>
<p>They dropped Verona off with hugs.  Then when Lucy turned around, Charles was gone.</p>
<p>Lucy led her mom by the hand, through Kennet below.</p>
<p>She knew Avery was really anxious about things, and how it was all presented to her parents.  The Garricks were meant to be something that represented what Avery was shooting for.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;d come <em>here</em> instead.</p>
<p>Here, where it was still creepy.  Where people were dangerous.  There was a shopping cart with barbed wire working through it, and a kid in a pillowcase nailed to a window, struggling.  There were Stuck-Arounds-</p>
<p>Who crossed the street, eyes down, when they recognized Lucy.</p>
<p>They went across downtown, over a ways.</p>
<p>And in front of the town hall, which was decrepit, a clear party spot, there was a fountain.  A Dog Tag sitting by the fountain jumped to her feet.  Angel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Standing guard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just stopping in,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Angel nodded.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll go for a short walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Angel left, Lucy looked up at the statue of the dogs on top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I had my guitar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is John?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess.  Memorial.  I negotiated for this with the local city spirit.  Lis.  Who helped Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom said that like she understood, which she might have, or like she was just getting past the conversation so she could get to where she was rubbing Lucy&#8217;s back and giving her a kiss on the top of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry this has been such a nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather know,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;Not knowing is the nightmare.  Being quietly oblivious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Verona was missing having someone with her, today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think we should call her mom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking&#8230; Tashlit, maybe.  I really don&#8217;t know how her mom would react.  It might be she&#8217;s too far away, you know?  Not close enough to any of this?  It&#8217;d just&#8230; not happen, with innocence and everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty worried about her, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll focus on that next.  After this.  After-&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a whoop in the distance.</p>
<p>Lucy listened, and heard very specific sorts of chatter.  Vulgar chatter.</p>
<p>She grabbed her mom&#8217;s arm, then pulled, getting her to where she was out of sight.</p>
<p>There were four gremlins with music players, and more goblins dancing and bouncing as they walked, shoving into one another, in a continual, mostly knee-high mosh pit.  With America at the center.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d taken up roost in the old town hall of Kennet below.  She wore a top hat with an arrow through it, and a kind of combination of a suit and post-apocalypse gladiator gear, various things strapped or stapled on, patching it, and added as accessories.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey soldier girl!&#8221; America hollered.</p>
<p>Angel, in the distance, broke into a sprint.</p>
<p>The goblins and America chased her.  They were being led away.</p>
<p>Lucy waited until there wasn&#8217;t even a straggler of a goblin panting for breath before she relaxed any.  &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re okay.  We owe Angel something.  Not sure what she likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the worry in her mother&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Her mom had said she&#8217;d rather know, but the way she&#8217;d found out, in the worst moment, with so much stress around all of this?  That was America Tedd&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>Karma hadn&#8217;t really doled out any responsibility for that.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>If Lucy was going to have any say, she had to do it soon, make a statement to the universe, using presentation, timing, coup.</p>
<p>Quietly, deep in thought, thinking again of that fight with Logan, wearing clothes she didn&#8217;t feel bulletproof in, worrying about what her mom would think, and worrying about all the complications again, Lucy drew a diagram.  Small.</p>
<p>Holding onto the dangling part of her earring, she passed it through.  Listening on the other side.  No footsteps, no conversation, even distant.  No breathing.</p>
<p>Her mom watched everything.</p>
<p>If her mom had doubted her, if there had been any skeptic in her, then would that have made the practice harder?</p>
<p>She got the bigger diagram done, which was a process of drawing, keeping an eye and ear out for any patrolling goblins, and checking this wasn&#8217;t all for nothing if someone happened to bring their dog through on a walk and sit down on a bench for a while.</p>
<p>One series of papers, passed through the small diagram.</p>
<p>Blown as if by wind, they would seek out the nearest light sources on a timer.  One in the first five seconds, one after ten, then one after fifteen, then one after twenty.</p>
<p>Lucy led her mom into the center of the circle, then activated it.</p>
<p>They arrived in darkness.  Near a town center and surrounding area that looked really nice, after the expensive and probably badly spent revitalization of the area.</p>
<p>The partially built fountain stood there, with a soldier at the top.  The last components- an epigraph to be mounted on the central stone bit below the soldier, mainly, they were stacked to one side.</p>
<p><em>I got this</em>, she thought, touching the stone rim of the fountain.</p>
<p>She looked up at her mom.</p>
<p>So much fear and worry there in the instant before she realized Lucy was looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You okay to walk a bit more?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I work on my feet, I can do it if you can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled, even though she was aware of the tension in her mom.  All the accumulating worries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery, check the thing with the Garricks is going okay.  Then home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look forward to the home part in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>They walked.  Lucy bit back the tense feeling that came with Charles&#8217; ask, the weight of lives put on her, that they&#8217;d avoided talking about, and everything else going on with America, Musser, the invaders.</p>
<p><em>As much as Avery&#8217;s going to hate it, we&#8217;ll need to bring in Liberty.  And we gotta make the stakes clear.</em></p>
<p><em>America fucked with our families.  There&#8217;s karmic responsibility on the line.  If Liberty can&#8217;t get her sister to back the fuck off and make amends, then America&#8217;s going to find out what&#8217;s changed since my fight with Logan.</em></p>
<p><em>Back then, didn&#8217;t matter I was outraged, didn&#8217;t change how the fight went.  It&#8217;s why it hurt more when I lost.</em></p>
<p><em>Now I can and will turn that outrage into some messed up shit.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m apparently supposed to give you a very important message, before anything,&#8221; the boy told her, with a voice that sounded like it was coming from far away.  He had little play-bricks made of skin interconnecting one another, creating a loose helmet around his head, with a single hole for his plastic eye to peer out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s very important&#8230;&#8221; Verona replied, &#8220;Run it by me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to say it exactly?  It&#8217;s an Oh Me Oh My.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;I wonder if she had to go to America for that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The evil goblin lady?&#8221; the boy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, actual America.  Nevermind.  You did a good job.  Got a memo I can fill out?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy approached, wary, and passed her a paper.  Verona filled in the form.  There was a little box at the bottom to check, marked &#8216;special circumstance?&#8217;</p>
<p>This counted.</p>
<p>She handed it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m supposed to bring something back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, after.  Let me think on how to approach it.  Hi Boy Suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; Boy Suspicious said.  He looked at the art on the wall of Verona&#8217;s Demesne, periodically moving his skin-helmet around to better peer through the hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you suspicious in personality, or do other people find you suspicious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends on the day.  People start treating you a certain way, you start acting a certain way back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; Verona replied.  &#8220;Can I get you anything?  Tea?  Snacks?  I&#8217;ve got only a limited few things, I don&#8217;t have a great idea of how long you were out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not long.  I&#8217;m alright.  You&#8217;re a witch, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.  Need anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you make love potions?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.  Could I?  Maybe.  Would I?  Probably not.  You&#8217;d need a <em>really </em>valid, non-sketchy reason, like maybe a little booster shot before a honeymoon, or an arranged marriage where you&#8217;re both tossing one back to help make the rest of it go down easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have a really valid, non-sketch reason, buddy?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might and I might not.  I&#8217;m going to play that one close to the vest,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know you all that well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.  Well, I guess that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re introducing yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I like your wall art.  And ceiling art.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how this works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, the tattooed girl sitting outside is supposed to explain that, to expedite.  It&#8217;s literally why I&#8217;m bribing her to hang out there.  She seems to have forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you think I shouldn&#8217;t have this house with its influence over a little bit of Kennet found property, let me know, and we&#8217;ll have a challenge.  It&#8217;ll be reasonably fair.  If you win, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean I lose my claim, but it&#8217;ll hurt, and it&#8217;ll impact all the claims to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like you&#8217;re alright.  &#8216;Course, I don&#8217;t really know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we each ask each other questions.  Like, I could ask you&#8230; what do you do?  Special Lost abilities, perks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do this,&#8221; he said.  He stuck two fingers inside the helmet, then pulled out his eye, along with the accompanying block with eyelid and stuff.  He brought it down to his foot, where his boot had a metal cap on the end, and clicked it into place.  Then he stuck his toe out.  &#8220;For looking under stuff.  And if I do this&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled it off, then pulled out a tiny spray paint can, along with a bunch of polaroid photos.  He hurried to step on the photos before Verona could see, and he sprayed the eye with metallic paint.  It squinted shut while he worked.</p>
<p>He clicked it back onto his toe.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;you can barely see it,&#8221; he finished.  &#8220;I can get pictures and video with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <em>can</em> barely see it.  You need to look at the undersides of things much, B.S.?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged.  &#8220;How much do you need to know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He crouched down to pull the eye off, and while he was crouched, collected the fallen photographs, being careful not to let her see them, keeping his hand between her and the pictures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t.  How open are you to outside work?  If I wanted to hire you for a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m open.  Do you have a criminal record?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, unless they track truancy or something, but I probably really <em>should</em>.  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your ability to navigate Kennet above?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;If ten is high and you&#8217;d have zero problems?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three.  Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you take the same routes home every time you finish with school or&#8230; this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you asking because you want to know if I&#8217;m being safe, assessing my character, or because you&#8217;re going to do something horrible if you can find the chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say the first one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; she said, nodding.  She made a note.  &#8220;And if I wanted to get in touch and couldn&#8217;t find you, I&#8217;m aware there&#8217;s some difficulty there.  Do you have a way?  Any friends?  Family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m usually around the neighborhood.  I can be hard to spot, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad&#8217;s Douglas Did It.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Douglas Did It do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you asked, he&#8217;d say he built a lot of important buildings.  He&#8217;d say he did that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t.  Because obviously this place didn&#8217;t exist all that long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously.  So Douglas didn&#8217;t do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s Douglas Did It, so he&#8230; did it, if you know what I mean.  Did a lot of things.  You just shouldn&#8217;t really ask too many questions about them.  Or it gets awkward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the weird interplay of having a role and identity in a found place that ties into things that didn&#8217;t really happen, or because he did something that wasn&#8217;t building?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did a <em>lot</em> of things that weren&#8217;t building.  Because he&#8217;s Douglas Did It.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s awkward to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.  Okay.  So you&#8217;ve got your dad.  I can maybe ask him, but I shouldn&#8217;t ask too much about what he did&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could get, uh, complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a sister too.  Uma On the Run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uma,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;I think I can see the gimmick coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hard to get in touch with though.  But if you really needed me, I guess you could try?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.  And I suppose I&#8217;m meant to not ask too many questions about whether she&#8217;s out for a jog or marathon training, or if it&#8217;s because she committed a crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically you&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty.  My family believes very strongly in that.  I wouldn&#8217;t say she&#8217;s on the run because she committed a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, right.  I&#8217;m talking more about the dynamic around her.  Whether she did it or didn&#8217;t do it-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad&#8217;s the one who did it,&#8221; Boy Suspicious said.  &#8220;He did a lot of things.  Things we don&#8217;t talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough being his kid.  With what he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, uh, to answer the original question, I don&#8217;t have many friends.  This is the longest, coolest non-family conversation I&#8217;ve had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  Neat.  Let me know if you come to a decision, by the way.  If you want to contest my claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d rather you were around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  So then you&#8217;d say <em>no contest</em>, you carry on, and I go back to answering the various claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, uh, no contest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  Cool.  That&#8217;s that, I guess.  Do you want to be dropped off in Kennet found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhh, I was thinking Kennet below.  I hear things about Kennet below.  Interesting things, contacts I could make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I need to get prepped first.  Drop me back off where I came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can do.  Can you do me a favor?  Run a message back to the girl with the tattoos?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Oh wait, she said, before you asked me to pass her anything, I&#8217;m supposed to say something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run it by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said if you give her another response that ends with S, she&#8217;s going to do something horrible to you the next chance she gets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be getting to her.  Okay.  Tell her Yum Bums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yum Bums?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And tell her she really needs to start explaining the rules and expediting this a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Thanks for stopping in, Boy Suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had to,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;For reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you in my notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his eye back and then left.</p>
<p>Verona got up and stretched, getting some lemonade from the other room.  She was halfway to her chair in the living room when the door opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enter the next contender,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>The next contender was a pigeon the size of a pigeon, wearing a rat mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>It bird-walked its way in, crossing the room at a relatively slow pace, because it was a bird, with bird legs.  It stuck its head and mask under one wing, then pulled out a slip of paper.  It flapped up onto the arm of the chair, and laid the paper down there.</p>
<p>Verona took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap paps.  Oh man, I forgot about those.  They got mass-recalled, I wonder if they&#8217;re still for sale in the Undercity.  They&#8217;re these little sticks, you gotta pap them up, then you stick them in this little pocket of rocks that fizzle and pop on your tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for delivering that message.&#8221;</p>
<p>It bobbed its head, then stuck its head back under the wing, pulling out a business card.  It laid it on the arm of the chair.</p>
<p>Verona picked it up.  It had a watermark of a squirrel and pigeon on the front, with &#8216;Squiring &amp; Servantry Squared Away&#8217; on the front.  On the back was a resume in fine print.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.  Hmmm!  Interesting.  Two hundred and thirty-nine years of experience as general servant and helpful citizen.  Weren&#8217;t you all servants or citizens?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon cooed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, it reads like padding, and if you have to pad a resume on a business card, size five font or no&#8230; let&#8217;s see.  Tasks included cleaning, patrols, three years of secondary duties when Falling Oak Avenue needed more birds.  What&#8217;s that commute like?  Did you go back and forth?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head, then nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years spent watching through window of a seamstress place in Sootsleeves&#8217; kingdom.  Periodic visits to the Promenade, Hang Out, the Skeined Alive, plus two, to observe experts at work.  What&#8217;s the plus two?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery might be interested in anything to do with the Paths.  Even names of these other two places.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon shook its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I interpret that as she&#8217;s not interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon shook its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so she might still be interested, but no because&#8230; names of the other places?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nodded once, then shook its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.  You can&#8217;t name them, or they&#8217;re unnamed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.  Paths that haven&#8217;t been labeled.  That must get confusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good, though.  Avid interest.  So I guess when you were wandering or on vacation from Sootsleeves&#8217; realm, you&#8217;d visit places, watch tailors at work?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;And other things at work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  I admire that.  Hmm.  Six instances of evasive target fulfillment?  What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon stuck its masked face under one wing, then rooted around for a minute.  It checked its other wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget where you put it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nuzzled through chest feathers, then belly feathers.  It pulled out a piece of paper, folded into quarters.  Verona unfolded it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhh.  So if someone tried to use tricks to avoid being assigned more errands, while running around Sootsleeves&#8217; kingdom, you were able to get the errands to them anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon cooed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  You know, Kennet found could just use more eyes, looking for those dodging writs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon took flight, startling Verona.  It caught the business card in its beak, and tugged, and she could have held on, but she let it take it.</p>
<p>It returned to the armchair, put the card down, and tapped it with the beak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to do that.  Got it.  Well, I hate to break it to you-&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;-but I&#8217;ve already got someone handling the cleaning.  She&#8217;s got dibs.  Now, I&#8217;m not saying <em>no</em>, but what you&#8217;re going to have to do is go to Chloe, she lives at the factory, she&#8217;s mostly awake at night.  She may be out and around, depending, so you might have to hunt, or leave a message.  Work it out with her.  Division of duties, anything like that.  She&#8217;s a ghoul, so you know, be mindful, if she&#8217;s in a bad state don&#8217;t go flying into claw&#8217;s reach or anything.  Don&#8217;t be pushy, respect her space.  Then once you&#8217;ve negotiated something, get back to me.  How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon cooed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get on my case to change up my outfits or anything?  Because I like the clothes I like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon shook its head, then took flight abruptly, startling Verona again.</p>
<p>She watched as it did a circuit of the room, coming to roost in the back of the chair,  It examined her sleeve, then hop-walked up her arm to her shoulder, nudging the back of her top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you want to see the tag?&#8221; she asked.  She reached back and pulled out the tags, holding them up and apart.  Upside down.</p>
<p>She could feel a little beak tugging at the tags.</p>
<p>It took off again, right by her ear, startling her again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gah!  We need to work out a system so that&#8217;s a little less nerve-wracking,&#8221; she told it.</p>
<p>She watched as it flew out to the far end of the couch, to a space Verona couldn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>Verona walked over, and looked down.  The pigeon jumped a little as her shadow passed over it.  It had a tiny fountain pen in its beak, mask pushed up, and paper on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go ahead,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>It finished writing, flicked its head forward to get the mask to flip down back into place, then tucked the pen under one wing, and picked up the paper.  It flapped up to the armrest of the couch, then put the paper down.</p>
<p>Verona was careful with how she picked the paper up, because the ink was still wet.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Garage sale, 1 wknd, dark gray off-shoulder sweater, thick cable knit.  Long in body.  Elegance &amp; class.  Highly recommend.  $15.  Req. quick clean cold wash &amp; fine brush, we can handle before delivery.  +2 more.</em></p>
<p><em>Thrift store.  Sorted but not on sale.  G.mother hand knit, high neck.  Rainbow stripe.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right on the money about the stripes but I&#8217;m not sure about the rainbow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon craned its beak upward.  Verona brought the paper down.</p>
<p>It quickly struck out the first and second entry, then drew a little arrow from the &#8216;+2 more&#8217; to a series of horizontal lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another sweater with stripes you think I might like?&#8221;</p>
<p>It flipped the paper over.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>O.sized</em></p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a size or two too big for me?  I kinda like big.  Good for the right circumstances.  Count me as interested.  If the colors are right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Tan &amp; black</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  Neat.  I can roll with that.  And you didn&#8217;t have to scratch out the first one.  I love stripes but if you think that&#8217;s really classy and elegant&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon tilted its head, then winked at Verona.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;which you seem to do, I could be into that.  A sweater I could wear to a party or to the Faerie courts, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;For eighteen bucks?  Okay.  Sure.  I&#8217;ll go get that, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon shook its head.  Then it flew over to the business card, tapping it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your job.  Right.  Do I give you money and you go get that handled?  Can you handle it?  Seems awkward for a bird to go buy something on my behalf.  That&#8217;s in Kennet above, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Coo.  Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we thinking?  Eighteen for the elegant sweater?&#8221;  Verona got her wallet out, then gave the bird money.  &#8220;At this point it&#8217;s almost worth being ripped off, if you fly away and don&#8217;t return the money or deliver the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out a twenty.</p>
<p>The pigeon, in the process of taking the money, dropped it.  It landed on the business card.  The pigeon looked up at her, beak open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I offend?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Sorry.  Didn&#8217;t mean to imply.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon took the money and tucked it under one wing, moving so as to keep one constant eye on Verona.</p>
<p><em>At this point if you conned me this well, acted this offended, and fly off with the money, it&#8217;s still worth it</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy&#8217;s looking to change out her wardrobe to more ethically sourced products,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;So you could try her.  See what she thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is cool.  Even if some of your job conflicts with Chloe, there&#8217;s other things.  But maybe you can work it out with her.  What are your rates?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon shook its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free?  No, that&#8217;s sketchy.  I&#8217;d want to pay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bird flew over to the fireplace, and settled down there.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you want to live in my Demesne?  A live-in servant and squire?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.  Then one wing lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon pushed its head into the wing-feathers, until two were sticking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two?  Two&#8230; live in servants and squires?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon put its wing down, nodded, then fixed the feathers it had ruffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk.  I think I&#8217;d insist on paying you at least something modest, and I don&#8217;t have a ton of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon flew over, then extended one wing forward.</p>
<p>Verona tentatively reached out, then shook it, like she was shaking the bird&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any strong feelings on my Demesne claim?  Contest?  No contest?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bird shook its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No contest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Thanks.  Can I give you a message?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Pass it to the girl with tattoos on your way out?  I&#8217;m assuming you either want to go to Kennet found or you can get between the worlds okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Verona said.  She wrote down <em>Sennalax, </em>then handed the paper over.</p>
<p>She remembered seeing the ads.  The old woman groaning and moaning in discomfort, then the delicate, sun-shining, slow-motion bite of the chocolate, and the sigh of relief when she left the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s technically a candy, because it&#8217;s coated in chocolate.  We&#8217;ll see how much she whines about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bird tucked the paper away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.  We&#8217;ll talk again, barring extraordinary circumstance, death, disaster, yadda yadda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pigeon nodded, and then hop-walked its way out of the house.</p>
<p>This really wasn&#8217;t super exciting, but it was nice to have an excuse to meet Others she wouldn&#8217;t have run into otherwise.  Like Boy Suspicious.</p>
<p>Having pigeon and squirrel servants around would be weird.  She kind of wanted it to be her space, when it wasn&#8217;t essentially a sleepover with her friends.</p>
<p>Her Demesne technically extended from the property to the point the woods started.  Would the pigeon and squirrel be okay with a living space outside?  A little building adjunct?</p>
<p>Or would asking a pigeon and squirrel to live outside be racist, operating on too many assumptions?</p>
<p>The door opened.  Verona fixed her mask, pulling it into place.</p>
<p>He entered, looking around.  Buzzed head, scar at the eyebrow, big jacket that made her think of a cat with its fur on end or a dog with its hackles up, puffing up to look scarier, gauntlet, jeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easton, hi,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I, third witch of Kennet, nascent sorceress, dabbler in Halflight, in shadow, she who hatched the moon and conceptualized Kennet found, receive you to this claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s tacky as shit,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;What&#8217;s that nascent sorceress bull?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stating my goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?  You&#8217;ve got a long way to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus the &#8216;nascent&#8217;.  You&#8217;re not too bright, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you do with Sutton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Myles?  We had a chat, played a game, then I booted him out.  Which I&#8217;m reserving the right to do to you, when we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta bring him back.  They&#8217;re having a big meeting, we&#8217;re working out options.  I owe him one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big meeting, huh?  You weren&#8217;t invited?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgive them.  If you want, I can put you where I put Myles when we&#8217;re done.  Contest or no contest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contest, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the claim, dude.  My town, two thirds already claimed, this is more or less a formality, I had a key role in founding the third third of Kennet that I&#8217;m wanting my Demesne to connect to, I&#8217;ve already got alliances, already have-&#8221;</p>
<p>She checked her notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty Foundlings saying they&#8217;re cool with this, no contest.  Three victories, one loss to you chumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can lose again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, but it&#8217;s pretty stacked in my favor.  I get to choose the contest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  By old laws, there&#8217;s a right to challenge by combat.  I can twist the-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really pulling this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-I can twist the contest in intent, to make it a martial one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re copying Anthem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty standard.  I would understand if someone who hasn&#8217;t been educated on the various intricacies-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve educated myself, thank you,&#8221; she answered.  &#8220;And if we do a trial by combat, I still get to set terms.  The claim is so overwhelming, I can pull fun stunts like ruling out you using practice, making you fight with a hand tied behind your back&#8230;  You really want to go this route?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can gainsay you.  You said you got to choose the contest, but you don&#8217;t.  You-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rule of rich omission, blah blah blah, there&#8217;s a natural fill in the blank at the end of my statement, it&#8217;s not a statement that makes sense if you consider all the options.  I studied that bullcrap too, by the way.  I hate being gainsaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty big stretch of that rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to call a judge to mediate it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah ha, and there it is.  You know the game&#8217;s rigged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you just crowing about how you get to rig the game and make it a trial by combat?  Well, anyway, you can make the gainsaying claim if you want.  Do you want to?&#8221;</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine.  Then on the <em>other</em> thing we were debating&#8230; I&#8217;ll let you make the call.  Combat or something of my choice.  Just know, I&#8217;ve got claim like <em>fuck </em>so this is my game, my rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What contest would you want?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.  I&#8217;m in the mood to draw.  Art contest.  Which is objectively better?  If it&#8217;s too close to call, we call it a truce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Okay.  Conditions, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that very easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I win, you get dumped in Kennet found, and you have to give me something.  Full and complete practice I don&#8217;t already know, non-consumable magic item, or power enough to fuel a non-consumable magic item.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I get the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Fuck no.  Why would you ever get the same?  I have the claim to this space, dude.  You get&#8230; maybe you get to keep the picture I drew, and I&#8217;ll even sign your art or my art and say you won, and you can show people and be all proud and shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull, that kind of disparity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re the one who barged in here.  My claim, my rules.  You want to ask the spirits?  You want to take it to a judge?&#8221;</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude, Easton, have you guys been steamrolling other Lordship claims and Demesne stuff by pulling that crap?  With people who don&#8217;t know the rules or think you&#8217;re way more impressive than you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m impressive enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t look impressive when I dumped you into Kennet below and you had to deal with the Vice Principal&#8217;s group, did you?  Oh, is that coup?  I think it&#8217;s coup,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;Oh, that counts for a bit more claim here, doesn&#8217;t it?  That I beat you once already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a bit.  Let&#8217;s do your contest, you can try gloating after.  But for my prize?  I get to hit you.  Once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fist only,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;No gauntlet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gauntlet&#8217;s part of me.  Implement.  I gotta insist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, but when I dump you out of here, I won&#8217;t be nice about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever.  We&#8217;ll see if we get that far.  Shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s.&#8221;  She walked over to the other room, motioning.  Easton followed her, and they each went to separate ends of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supplies are here,&#8221; she said, moving them from a lower shelf to the edge of the table closest to the wall.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to cheat, and I know this table has weird grooves, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She banged on the table.  The slats aligned to be perfectly flat, and the little holes for pegs and measuring tools to go in all filled in.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you do that?  Special table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s technically my Demesne.  I completed it already, but for two different parts of Kennet.  I&#8217;m not using it to cheat, but it&#8217;s a nice convenience, still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Double Demesne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thirds of one, like I said.  I&#8217;m rounding it out with this last claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People were wondering,&#8221; Easton said.</p>
<p>He sounded less intense than he had at the start.  Too calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you get back to those people, you can tell them if you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.  What are we drawing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each other?&#8221; she offered.  &#8220;Any style, any pose.  No nude figure drawing, though.  That&#8217;s reserved for friends only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really care that much about seeing you naked, so that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221; she paused.  &#8220;Well fuck you too, then, dude.  You&#8217;re not my type either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Annoyed now, she set about drawing, fine-point art pen, emulating a style she&#8217;d seen done for tattoos, where each plane of the body was given its own shading and hatching.  Different textures too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Art class at private institutions,&#8221; Easton said.  &#8220;Our teachers were respected artists, not just whatever whacko got a teaching degree and couldn&#8217;t teach math.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ours is okay, here.  Definitely more in that whacko direction than the respected artist, but she&#8217;s a good teacher,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wanted to reply, but she shut her mouth.  Wasn&#8217;t worth it, and she had the feeling he was counting coup some by being an ass.  The annoyance felt like it was affecting her drawing more than it usually would.  She put her energy into the drawing instead, putting him out of mind.</p>
<p>Which was nice.  Bit of a break, bit of a recharge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your hand up?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;The gauntlet?  Maybe make a cool fist?&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his hand, giving her the finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That works.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure would be nice if the Blue Heron was up and running,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get expelled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, kinda, but in an ideal world, it starts up again, we can tweak things, make nice&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think nice is a long fucking away off,&#8221; Easton said.  &#8220;Are you going to talk the entire time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My house, my call.  I&#8217;d want to go back, given a choice.  Cut away the bullshit, put someone cool in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t think Musser is cool, there&#8217;s something wrong with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s objectively cool.  He&#8217;s handsome, fit, snappy, expensive fashion, he&#8217;s unflappable, he&#8217;s a man with a plan, with the ability to carry stuff out.  He can handle himself in a fight, he could talk to a billionaire without flinching, he might even <em>be</em> a billionaire, I don&#8217;t know.  If he wasn&#8217;t already married &#8211; to an actual babe, I&#8217;ll point out, he&#8217;d have women throwing themselves at him.  Probably does anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barf?  We&#8217;re talking about Abraham Musser?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One and the same.  Barf barf barf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be so lucky as to have a guy like him.  A guy <em>half</em> his caliber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You not recognizing how much he has to offer says more about you than it does about him, you realize that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude, I&#8217;m not sure I can accurately convey how little interest I have in him or anyone like him.  He&#8217;s gross, he treats his niece like shit, he threw away his own son, he treats his familiars like slaves-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I surprised you see having powerful familiars under firm control as a negative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-and I&#8217;m supposed to think he&#8217;d treat a woman nice?  He&#8217;ll raise good kids?  I don&#8217;t even want to marry or have kids-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the future of the world seems a little brighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, and fuck off.  Part of the reason I&#8217;m so disinterested is the world&#8217;s already getting pretty full and there&#8217;s people like him in it.  He&#8217;s sleaze, he picks on the weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard not to be seen as picking on the weak when you&#8217;re one of the strongest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bully, he&#8217;s a shitty leader, he&#8217;s shitty enough to bail and leave all of you behind to fend for yourselves while the Carmine Exile is pulling this bullshit, so yeah, no, I don&#8217;t even want to have kids or marry in the first place, but if it came to having his kids?  Or anyone like him?  I&#8217;d chew off my ring finger before he could put something on it.  I&#8217;d rather reach up inside myself and perform an auto-hysterectomy first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big word, I&#8217;m sure you feel very smart.  You&#8217;re defective and you&#8217;re a sore loser, that&#8217;s all this is.  Musser is the man guys want to be, and the man non-defective girls want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barf.  Barf barf barf on top of a tacky line.  But you do you, Easton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <em>will</em> do me, actually.  You&#8217;re a wrinkle in the carpet others are walking down and when they pass you&#8217;ll be stomped out, with barely a second thought.  And the fact you&#8217;d do it while being so <em>blind</em> to passing greatness is really fucking pitiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Passing greatness?  Have you had your fill of sucking on his dick, yet?  You&#8217;re <em>really</em> on board the Musser train, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could drink a potion, become a woman, and be Abraham Musser&#8217;s next wife, or someone equivalent, a little less old, I would suck that dick with <em>fanatical</em> zeal, for all the perks, fortune, standing, and everything else I could get by doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona stopped drawing and looked over at Easton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a moron for not feeling the same way,&#8221; Easton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude, Easton, man, that&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> to unpack, but hey, you do you, chase your dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve clearly demonstrated your inability to understand a lot of things, if you can&#8217;t &#8216;unpack&#8217; anything, I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; Easton said, drawing away.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re this oblivious, I really do think you just self-couped.  I didn&#8217;t know that was possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha ha.  As if.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m done,&#8221; she said.  She slapped her paper down face-down onto the table.  &#8220;First one finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter.  It&#8217;s a question of how good it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good.  But we&#8217;ll see.  I call on house, Demesne, spirits, any Judges who have a moment free and want to do something fun and deliver a bias-free verdict on an art contest.  I call on you.  When Easton is done, let the scales be weighed.  Shall I get my prize, or shall he get to take a swing at me before fucking thoroughly off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be a few minutes,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Art takes time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go for it,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching you lose?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem so sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew from the moment I got to this sad-ass town you&#8217;re trying so hard to protect.  You&#8217;re going to lose, wrinkle in the carpet, and your backwards-ass ways of thinking and handling all this are going to be forgotten before you know it, <em>wild practitioner.</em>  It&#8217;s going to be satisfying to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Someone&#8217;s</em> grumpy about falling for a stupid trap from a supposed backwards-ass wild practitioner.  Gosh, was that embarrassing?  How was the walk back?  How did your buddies there take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They took it fine.  Do you guys fall into disarray every time one of you fucks up?  Because I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, just disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took him another five minutes to finish his drawing.  He pushed it across the table, and it stopped at the halfway point.  Verona turned hers over and did the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s better,&#8221; he said, smirking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah. You sure did draw me at a healthy size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unhealthy size.  Don&#8217;t pretend you&#8217;re anything but.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m not anorexic?  Yeah, that&#8217;s still not right.  That looks more like my mom with my haircut than me.  Gosh, do you need glasses?  That would explain a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirits, house, judges, and any other forces that want to weigh in?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>Lines lifted away from the pictures.  They animated, becoming as tall as their respective subjects.  The images walked over until they overlapped.  Easton&#8217;s image over Verona, lines standing out in three dimensions, Verona&#8217;s image of Easton over him.</p>
<p>The lines shook and broke at the sides of Verona&#8217;s stomach and hips, then at her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull,&#8221; Easton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, didn&#8217;t learn how to draw hands?  Or scale them to the size of my actual hands?  I can sympathize,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been practicing though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bullshit,&#8221; he said, moving his hands around.  Some of her lines broke, but it was one twentieth, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>It broke around her eyes too.  Easton had a few around his face break, but it was less.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t learn to draw eyes properly?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I drew them fine, in my style.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The arbiters of the universe don&#8217;t think so.  Guess that private school art class doesn&#8217;t count for much, compared to actually putting in the effort over months and years, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The house creaked.  Then it tilted.  Verona remained upright, and felt the weight of the lines like they were steel rebar and not something ethereal.  Easton, with more of the lines hanging off him, sagged.</p>
<p>He slid about five feet toward the living room.  Verona slid about one or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever think, in moments like these, that maybe you&#8217;re wrong?  That your private school education doesn&#8217;t count for as much as you think it&#8217;s worth, that Musser isn&#8217;t as fellatio-worthy as you seem to think he is?  That you&#8217;re on the wrong side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Easton said.  &#8220;I really don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t even realize how much of a self-coup that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a thing.  Self-coups aren&#8217;t a thing that exists.  The very idea of coup implies two parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might not be a thing but you sure seem to be trying to make it a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slid further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay up,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He reached into a pocket, and then seemed to reconsider.  He went for the inside of his jacket, and pulled out a little book with a metal cover.  There was something etched on the front &#8211; a red sword.</p>
<p>He flipped through the booklet, then tore pages out from near the back.  He tossed them out so they&#8217;d land on the floor.  &#8220;Practice.  Good luck figuring that one out.  Didn&#8217;t say it had to be at your skill level.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked around through the kitchen and into the front hall.  He slid into the hallway as she got there, grabbing at the doorframe and finding no grip.  &#8220;House on Half Street?  Kennet found.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lighting filtering in through the fogged-up windows changed, darkening.</p>
<p>Easton quickly pulled a visor out- like the sort that would go on a knight&#8217;s helmet, flipping up and down, and put it on.  It stayed there.  &#8220;Masked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But no permission slip.  What a shame.  Guess you&#8217;re still a repeat offender.  Now, because you wanted to hurt me, punch me with a steel gauntlet?  That comes full circle with the weight of claim behind me, I reserve the right to do this&#8230; mind your head.  I don&#8217;t want you to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>She kicked him.  And the lines broke explosively, helping to propel him, and the door opened.</p>
<p>Easton went down the front stairs, arms around his head.</p>
<p>In Kennet found, the front steps extended down a full floor, because the House on Half Street was on stilts, raised up like every building was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ow, fuck!  My elbow, fuck, fuck!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice faded, caught by the mist.</p>
<p>A squirrel squeezed its way in just before the door closed.  It held out a piece of paper with a paper clip holding the Squiring and Servantry business card.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;"><em>Xanthan Yum, no contest.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it.  Is she cheating?  Did she find a list or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel shrugged dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least you&#8217;re making it easy on me, huh?  Appreciated.  You&#8217;re the pigeon&#8217;s partner?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel nodded.</p>
<p>She extended a finger for it to shake.  &#8220;Thanks.  Talk to you another time.  Go see Chloe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and&#8230; hmmm.  Do you want dropped off back in Kennet found?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel gestured wildly, ran over to the stairs to bound up two steps, then gestured more, indicating the window, then pressing his ears down.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got another way?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good stuff.  That&#8217;s nice.  Luna mentioned that, I think.  One of the first ones to swing by did.  Means I&#8217;m not the ferry service.  Can you pass on a message?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a second.  M.  M, m, m.  Maahes bars.  And point out that the trademark goes after Maahes, so the last letter is an S, not an R.  Pass that on to the tattooed girl outside, if it&#8217;s no trouble.  Also, she needs to tell me if the Snap Paps are sold in Kennet below.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squirrel nodded.  Verona opened the door for it, and briefly wondered how the pigeon had gotten in and out.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>She had more water, washed her face, fixed her hair, and stretched some, working out the kinks from being hunched over the table, drawing.  Her thumb rolled its way around her palm as she mused.</p>
<p>She was <em>really</em> glad she&#8217;d beat Easton.  She would have been simmering in annoyance if she hadn&#8217;t, not to mention how much being gauntlet-punched would&#8217;ve sucked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona Hayward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice surprised her.  She hadn&#8217;t heard the door.</p>
<p>And the sound of that voice- rough edged, almost a growl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I interrupt your Demesne claim.  You lose nothing by this interruption.  It is simply the most convenient way for us to convene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Lucy and Avery came through.  Then their parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh wow.  Very artistic,&#8221; Kelsey said, in a tone of voice that made it sound like she was trying to be nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhhhh, hey,&#8221; Verona said, bewildered.  &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t intended as a place for parents.  Sorry for any nakedness on the walls or if you find any contraband lying around.  If you do, it was probably someone not-me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the choice between not including you, not including them, or including both, we went with the last one,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Sorry, we weren&#8217;t really in a position to ask you.  Doing the claim thing kind of means communication is hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would&#8217;ve sent someone to no-contest your claim and pass on a message, but Charles wasn&#8217;t up for waiting,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well you&#8217;re <em>all</em> jerks, then,&#8221; Verona said, before amending, &#8220;except Jasmine and Connor and Kelsey because I guess you guys care and junk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; Jasmine said.  &#8220;How long have you been here?  Are you doing okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona eyed Charles warily.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a three day ritual and I have no freaking idea how long it&#8217;s been going on, but there&#8217;s been a <em>procession</em> of Foundlings, so it&#8217;s felt a lot like a day, day and a half in real-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About right,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;That&#8217;s good, though, right?  Getting that much validation, that much claim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; Charles said, as he walked across the living room.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re eating okay?  You&#8217;re safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my house.  It&#8217;s weird time-wise, there are special rules.  I don&#8217;t really have to eat so much, here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a yes on either of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s getting better at this,&#8221; Lucy murmured, as she entered the living room.</p>
<p>He came to a stop at the same spot the Carmine furs had sat, standing beside the chair Verona had placed near there.  The red brick of the fireplace stretched up behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a plan to get the invaders out.  We were going to get the less violent types out, at least,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Brought the Garricks in.  Business deal for the Garricks, invaders get out, everyone&#8217;s more or less satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until Charles,&#8221; Lucy said.  She sat down in an armchair.  Verona sat down on the armrest, and slumped over, so her head could rest on Lucy&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Company was nice, if nothing else.  Even if some of that company was Charles.</p>
<p>Avery stood by the same chair, back to the wall, one foot propped up and wedged between the padded, removable seat and chair.  Snowdrop remained small.</p>
<p>The parents took the couch.  Jasmine sat furthest back, closest to the chair where Verona, Lucy, and Avery sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very you,&#8221; Jasmine said.  &#8220;I hope that&#8217;s okay to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me.  It&#8217;s mine.  I&#8217;m tied to it like Avery&#8217;s tied to Snowdrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love that there&#8217;s something artistic about it,&#8221; Jasmine told her.  &#8220;I was so disappointed when you stopped getting into art.  When you gave me that one picture, it wasn&#8217;t just that it was beautiful, it was that you were drawing again.  I love that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona smiled a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you get back to your Demesne claim and your drawings later,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;As I told the others, I thought we were overdue a conversation.  I hope we can talk things out and find some middle ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you forget you all have tried to murder us in the past?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Jasmine&#8217;s hands clenched in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want you to be part of this.  When it all began, I thought a child shouldn&#8217;t be in this role, it would be disastrous.  Several of my very first words in your presence were <em>emphatic</em> on that point.  But I was forsworn, and it didn&#8217;t matter.  If anything, I hurt my case by trying to argue it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head.  &#8220;You killed John.  You <em>used </em>Yalda.  You created the Hungry Choir that killed hundreds.  You helped set up a situation that soaked Kennet in the blood of the Carmine before you.  That made people aggressive, that got people killed, that made the emergency room busier in one summer than it was in the last five years combined.  Crime was so bad they had to bring in outside cops.  You brought in a man that dated my mom with the intention of getting close to her and he was meant to threaten to murder or murder her.  To distract me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona looked at Jasmine, who seemed startled by that.  By Charles&#8217; presence, by proxy.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a certain meaning of &#8216;you&#8217;.  I was part of the group that did that,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not even all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;Do you want to use our time here to put me on trial?  What do you think that would accomplish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly I want the parents to know who and what you are before you start spewing bullshit,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had any special animosity towards you.  I think I&#8217;ve gone easy on each of you since taking my position.  You clearly remain opposed to me, I don&#8217;t fault you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure as shit fault you, Chuck,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what the fuck?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;If you trying to kill us and murder my freaking mom isn&#8217;t any special kind of animosity then I&#8217;m left wondering what the heck <em>is.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re seeing it turned against Musser.  But I don&#8217;t want to argue.  I don&#8217;t want to make excuses, either, but in the interest of giving context?  Making sure all present know what we&#8217;re talking about?  Tell me, have the parents been informed of what forswearing is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been listening in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than you&#8217;d think.  Again, I have no particular grudge against you three,&#8221; Charles growled the words, the quality of his voice making it sound like he might.  &#8220;I aim to leave you alone as long as you&#8217;ll do the same.  I&#8217;m hoping our talk here means we know how much to leave alone and how much we might actually agree.  Have they been informed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise mentioned it in passing,&#8221; Jasmine said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure Connor and Kelsey were there for it.  Some kind of big punishment for breaking contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or oaths,&#8221; Charles said.  His hands gripped the back of the chair.  The red hair on the backs of his hands was really red.  &#8220;Make a serious oath or promise and break it, and the penalty is bankruptcy.  Not of wealth, specifically, but of <em>power</em>.  Of personal power, of social power, position, the ability to make the differences you want to make.  It&#8217;s a bankruptcy of financial power, yes, but also of all ability to practice.  It&#8217;s a loss of <em>everything</em>.  It leaves a man broken, lost, alone, and helpless.  Or a thirteen or fourteen year old girl.  It does not discriminate.  It is usually irrevocable, and it follows an individual to their grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles was forsworn,&#8221; Verona pointed out, mostly to break Charles&#8217; stride.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was forsworn and my every intent was poisoned.  I tried to make a trap for my enemies and it became a storm of hunger and bloodthirst that ate several hundred individuals.  The Hungry Choir.  Most lie down and give up well before that point.  But I want to ask you.  All seven of you- three girls, three adults, one opossum.  Do you really want to live in a world where the weak and downtrodden are meant to lie down and die?  Even if they&#8217;re as young as thirteen and fourteen?  Or as young as ten?  You&#8217;ve all seen Dom Driscoll among the invaders.  He could just as easily be caught in a broken promise as I, and have <em>everything</em> ripped from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really glossing over the immensely shitty things your side did,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that, but I&#8217;d like an answer to my question first.  Do you want to live in that world?  Or would you want there to be an answer and an opportunity to fight back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Kelsey said.  &#8220;I&#8217;d want there to be a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never liked forswearing,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Partially because we were empathetic to you, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed his head briefly in a nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t condone what you did,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  I&#8217;m not looking for condonation.  But I have to paint my perspective for you.  I was not only helpless, but my every action threatened to be undone and turned against me, turned into something <em>counter</em> to my aims.  That is what it is to be forsworn.  So I stepped down and I stepped back.  Others had their own goals.  Maricica, Edith, Lis joined late.  Others helped unwittingly, or in tertiary roles.  Bluntmunch, Cig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in the notes,&#8221; Lucy told her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You showed her the notes?&#8221; Verona asked, vaguely offended.  &#8220;The notes are a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles went on as soon as there was a break in the conversation.  &#8220;I knew that if I took the metaphorical reins, the horse would likely kill.  I knew that standing by and standing down would only continue to foster a world where the downtrodden and weak must bow to the strong.  So yes.  I let others make the decisions.  And Edith poisoned Matthew, and Maricica schemed, and people did die, others were threatened.  Jasmine Ellingson?  For what it&#8217;s worth, I don&#8217;t think the intent was ever for you to die.  But the fear had to be there for you to slow down.  For there to be a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For you to kill John,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For many things to come together.  Killing him included.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asshole,&#8221; Lucy said, very quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t deny that,&#8221; he said, voice lower than before, eyes dropping.  His face still had those deep lines, like a frown had etched itself permanent in there, and he was smiling past the frown always.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you had to do it, you think?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Desperation drove me every step of the way.  Yes.  More or less, I had to.  I know your parents are new to this.  A lot of it may not have the right impact, whether too much or too little.  I would like for you to imagine that we live somewhere where the law has truly and thoroughly failed us all.  Where the rich and strong use their power to get richer and stronger, where they use far too little power to protect the people at the bottom.  The forces meant to save us are used against us more than they&#8217;re used to our benefit.  Children get introduced to things they have no business being a part of, out of desperation, or because the people in power want to <em>use</em> them.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hard to imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Jasmine agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine, then, that an election is coming up.  That there&#8217;s a chance to run.  That nobody seems to wish to change the status quo except for one individual at the very bottom.  I&#8217;m not talking someone weak, or strong, or poor.  I&#8217;m talking about someone with <em>nothing</em>.  But to rise, he must hitch his fortunes to organized crime.  He must stand by and let them do as they will.  Only then can he take measures and affect change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like your measures are awfully bloody,&#8221; Connor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still doing what you were doing before, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Because now you&#8217;re in power, you&#8217;ve made your first actual obvious moves, people are running scared, right?  Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s&#8230; positioning Others to murder innocents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in that analogy, you promote the boss of the organized crime ring when you&#8217;re done?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>Charles turned very red eyes toward her.  &#8220;She promoted herself, I simply removed the usual obstacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Semantics,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That <em>is</em> the world we live in.  Semantics matter.  Oh, and one more thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not <em>close</em> to being done,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;So that&#8217;s ominous and all, and I hope the parents sorta understand where we&#8217;re at, but I&#8217;m not sure how we get from that to- to compromise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can compromise.  It would be nice.  But the reason I want to talk is to make things clear, clear away misconceptions, and see if there&#8217;s common ground we can work toward.  We made the agreement to leave each other alone while you claimed Kennet found.  And then Miss made her claim Carmine-exempt, I noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny how that works,&#8221; Verona said.  &#8220;That she wouldn&#8217;t want your fingers in her p- th- business?  I can&#8217;t think of an ending to that sentence that can&#8217;t be interpreted as rude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we carry on like we&#8217;re doing, there&#8217;s a chance we&#8217;ll find ourselves at odds again.  I have certain plans, you have your own, but as you bring the Garricks in, you&#8217;re getting in my way, and I&#8217;m forced to get in yours.  So let&#8217;s talk.  Let&#8217;s make sure we can each face down what I think we agree is our common enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re our enemy too, Charles,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;But you&#8217;re an enemy we can&#8217;t do much about.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Right now.</em></p>
<p><em>We talked about this in the nightmares</em>, Verona thought.  <em>During those planning meetings.  That we have to create the illusion we&#8217;re feeling hopeless against Charles</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me ask you,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;What do you think I&#8217;m even doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean besides creating a bunch of monsters and putting innocents at risk?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general.  My plan.  My ultimate goal.  What is it I hope to accomplish?  Your accuracy or any lack of accuracy will help me know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery looked over at Verona.</p>
<p>&#8220;If even they don&#8217;t get it, then haven&#8217;t you done a really bad job of things?&#8221; Connor asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.  If you&#8217;d try,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do we owe you anything?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t.  But if you want the Garricks to escort those people away, that puts me in a position where I&#8217;m conceding a lot.  Until we understand each other, can you really argue for me to give you that?  I&#8217;m offering to tell you things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maricica said&#8230;&#8221; Verona trailed off.  &#8220;&#8230;or she apparently said, to paraphrase, it&#8217;s turning the tables.  Musser was on top.  It puts him on the bottom, or close to. Takes the dangerous Others, puts them on top.  Now he has to live in his own dynamic, but on the other end.  They all do.  That wasn&#8217;t just about the then and there, was it?  It&#8217;s all of this.  You&#8217;re taking their power base away for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you gainsaid the children until parents got antsy, pulled them out of the Blue Heron?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;Taking away that power base?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether I hold this position for thirty days and then get extinguished, or hold it for three thousand years, I do think I will remain in awe at Miss&#8217;s ability to find the exceptional,&#8221; Charles said.  He leaned into the top of the chair, arms folded, rocking it forward on its two front legs.  &#8220;To the point it nearly cut past ten years of planning, past the schemes of a faerie, past deceit, and past a long series of obstacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obstacles sure is a polite way of talking about how you guys tried to kill us a bunch,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;And how you did kill good people.  Ken didn&#8217;t really do anything wrong and you extinguished him.  And you <em>used</em> Yalda.  You took John&#8217;s worst fears about a <em>child</em> John used to love, and you didn&#8217;t just-&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, shaking her head a little.  She reached into her top and pulled out the chain necklace.  The dog tag on the end, and the ring.  She leaned forward, elbows on knees, and held it out.</p>
<p>There was enough emotion in her eyes Verona found herself looking away.  She did catch Lucy looking at her mom, then looking away an instant later, fixating on Charles.</p>
<p>&#8220;-He killed Yalda to keep her from hurting anyone.  And she let him.  And he loved her.  He&#8217;d devoted his life to her.  But he didn&#8217;t want her to become a monster.  And then you brought her back, and- I don&#8217;t care it was a mistake.  You still <em>used</em> her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you&#8217;d used her for your original plan, by your notes, you would&#8217;ve been using her to kill.  Directly against what John wanted,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Lucy said, as if Verona had supplied something she was trying to say, or something she&#8217;d imperfectly remembered.  &#8220;That.  John was never anything but good to you, to <em>us</em>, really, a few freak-outs aside.  And you made his worst nightmare come true, and then you used it to murder him, and now you&#8217;re standing there acting like you&#8217;re compassionate or you admire us?  <em>Fuck you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears were welling up in Lucy&#8217;s eyes.  Verona reached over, and Jasmine started to rise to her feet, but Avery beat them both to it in giving Lucy a big hug.</p>
<p>&#8220;John would&#8217;ve- he said if it wasn&#8217;t for everything else, basically, he would&#8217;ve been my familiar.  Like Snowdrop is to Avery.  Except he would&#8217;ve been a dog, and he would&#8217;ve been a- a protector.  Someone to learn guitar with.  Someone- he gave <em>everything</em> for Yalda and I really do think- I wouldn&#8217;t want to replace her, but he would&#8217;ve done it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The loyalest of companions and the staunchest of protectors until the day you die,&#8221; Verona said, quiet.  She looked at Jasmine.  &#8220;Would be kind of cool, you know?  Super smart dog to protect your kid and love her, and she&#8217;d never have to say goodbye to it too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded, pushing the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would&#8217;ve loved that for you,&#8221; Jasmine said.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded again, then, hands still at her eyes, she said, &#8220;Stop fucking around, Charles.  Don&#8217;t play nice.  don&#8217;t admire us, don&#8217;t- just <em>stop</em>.  Tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright,&#8221; Charles said.  He stood taller.  &#8220;Fine.  Verona&#8217;s right.  If they want tradition, we&#8217;ll give them the old ways.  Monsters in the darkness, monsters ruling the wilderness, monsters ruling the supernatural sides of any city.  Innocents will die or worse, but in a few years or decades, it will calm down.  They will break.  The practitioner establishment must cease to be, and I will uproot every family, every position of power, and deny it to them.  Where need be, I will slaughter them, gainsay them, forswear them, or I will use other means to take enough from them that they will feel as if they were forsworn when they were not.  By leaving, pulling away, and giving up on Kennet, they have bought themselves time, but it will not matter.  And the rest of the practitioner world is going to let this happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll call reinforcements?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he will.  But those will be quashed.  The Carmine Beast was a monster, a fierce beast in shadow, slaughtering and laying waste to early Western civilization.  Raised up to the role of Carmine, she became something greater, even more fearsome, with more resources.  I was a summoner.  I too have been raised up, given vast resources.  I have made exceptional Others, using my skills and knowledge.  As summoner and as Forsworn, I did a great deal with very little, and now I&#8217;ve done <em>so, so </em>much more with vast resources at my disposal.  Many haven&#8217;t even been revealed, and won&#8217;t, until certain conditions are met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the rest of the world won&#8217;t notice and stop you?  You&#8217;re threatening everything that they are,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll let it happen and stand by as soon as they realize that they can stand back, point the finger at this wider region and say, <em>take notice, that is what happens if you overreach.  That is what happens if you grow complacent.  That is what happens if you don&#8217;t give the Forsworn their respect and due.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;That,&#8221;</em> Lucy said, pulling her hands down, glaring at Charles with eyes that were red because she&#8217;d cried and rubbed them, not because of Sight, &#8220;<em>is what happens when you remove us</em>, they&#8217;ll say.  All the other Mussers in the world, all the other real monsters.  And the strong and established get stronger and more established, and the weak become too scared to risk it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little hairs on Verona&#8217;s neck stood up.  She rubbed at her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s still plenty of time remaining to shape the lessons that this greater exercise will teach.  They haven&#8217;t made the moves necessary to remove me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if we don&#8217;t want to see?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then close your eyes.  Stand down.  From the very beginning, I said you shouldn&#8217;t be involved.  Not because you&#8217;re weak or incapable &#8211; it&#8217;s clear you aren&#8217;t either of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off,&#8221; Lucy told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a world meant for children.  The young shouldn&#8217;t be awakened or put at the risk of being forsworn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re teenagers,&#8221; Lucy told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d agree, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked the parents on the couch.</p>
<p>Jasmine frowned, looking down at her hands.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with a lot of the danger they were in, but my daughter could have had a forever dog that can play guitar, however that&#8217;s meant to work?  A protector?  And you took that away from her?  You made her cry?  Broke her heart?  Fuck you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plus all the murder and deaths,&#8221; Lucy said, eyes moist.  &#8220;We&#8217;re pissed off at that too.  And the shit you saw in the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not forgetting that either,&#8221; Jasmine said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles looked at Connor and Kelsey.</p>
<p>Connor shook his head a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; Charles murmured.</p>
<p>Verona looked at the empty space on the couch, then looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s underway is underway,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;The only way to break the back of a system this entrenched is to gut it.  I know you&#8217;ve encountered one of my snares-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;While you&#8217;ve been here.  The thirty bogeymen respond to threats by attacking pre-emptively,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know there were thirty bogeymen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many other such snares remain,&#8221; Charles said, talking past the interruption.  &#8220;I&#8217;d rather the practitioners who are trapped and scattered remain trapped and scattered.  Enabling the Garrick family to drop them off and pick them up would interfere with what I&#8217;m trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they stay, they may start fixating on how to get at you.  Or they may start banding together against the common enemy,&#8221; Verona pointed out.  &#8220;Especially now that- did he show himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t they be more scattered if you let them go?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t the lesson you&#8217;re trying to teach be more effective if you left them clinging to what they prize most, whatever they&#8217;ve built, whatever business they&#8217;ve got, their libraries, and then took those things away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far more difficult,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;And this is already difficult enough, trying to teach the right lessons while overcoming an organization of the strongest practitioners in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have ridiculous power at your fingertips, you&#8217;re a super summoner, and you <em>know</em> these jackasses, you&#8217;ve got an ex-fae naked blood goddess to advise you, and you can&#8217;t figure out a way to drive them apart or punish them?&#8221; Verona asked.  &#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like you agree with him,&#8221; Lucy said, accusatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t-&#8221; Verona paused, hesitating.  She changed what she was going to say.  &#8220;I think it&#8217;s dumb as <em>balls</em> if Chuck is pissed off enough to do what he&#8217;s done over the last ten years, keep the secrets, get people killed, pull the <em>shit</em> he pulled with us, kill John, and then whine <em>oh, it&#8217;s too hard</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re trying to bait me to get your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You also know- and I know because I got to basically be Carmine for a little while-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Jasmine asked.  &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t in the notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;-Chuck!&#8221; Verona raised her voice, so she wouldn&#8217;t lose her stride.  &#8220;You <em>know</em> I hate whining.  You know why.  You know I love this power, this- I love practice.  You know that.  You can see me, back to front, start to now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Charles replied.  &#8220;I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see how those things add up to me feeling-&#8221; she tried to sum up the feeling welling in her chest.  &#8220;This total <em>gross</em> contempt for you whining and trying to take it easy now?  Fucking us over like you did as long as you did, fucking over our town and our families, our friends, and then the moment you start winning, you shit all over all of that and <em>stop trying?</em>  <em>Wah wah, too hard?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bait,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;I can see that too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona rubbed at her hand, sitting back.  She stared at him.  He didn&#8217;t take his eyes off her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t me rising to the bait.  It is an attempt at compromise.  I&#8217;ll allow Peter Garrick to argue away the gainsaying if he can.  I won&#8217;t fight him too hard on it.  I won&#8217;t gainsay the others.  They can take the practitioners away.  Anyone willing to go.  They may make multiple trips if they need to, but after tonight, it must end.  They can take people out of Kennet, and no further.  On any further attempt to move people around, I will interfere and gainsay, or put threats in their way.  Let them know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery sighed in obvious relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were they at risk of being forsworn?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  The oaths they swore were mostly about how they&#8217;d handle stuff when the job was done, and securing payment.  They&#8217;re not that dumb,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;But it sure would&#8217;ve screwed up my ability to do business with them if they all got gainsaid and stranded here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verona.  You&#8217;ve already done three days of Demesne claim.  This is extraneous.  We&#8217;ll intensify the claim.  You can face down whoever is willing to show up in that short period, you&#8217;ll retain your precedent and firmly established claim.  If that&#8217;s alright?  It&#8217;ll give you the opportunity to wrap up tonight and be at school tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not my priority, kind of weird it&#8217;s yours,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <em>should</em> be a priority, Verona,&#8221; Jasmine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will also give you the ability to prepare, in case Abraham Musser decides to come back to strike at Kennet,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;If you can stall or stop him from a subsequent Lordship attempt, that serves everyone.  Even Abraham Musser.  If he knew the forces arrayed against him should he take Kennet, even he would balk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I have been the furthest thing from a friend, but I don&#8217;t want to be your enemy,&#8221; Charles said.  &#8220;If you spent even a day forsworn, you&#8217;d know that this all has to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it means killing?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total number of deaths will be far lower after I&#8217;m done.  Don&#8217;t underestimate what some of these practitioners do behind the scenes.  When the fighting has stopped, my bloody Lords will go dormant until challenged or provoked.  They&#8217;ve ceded leadership duties to the Judges, and if there&#8217;s nothing for them to fight, there&#8217;ll be no reason for them to be active.  When Kennet is awash in Carmine influence, it will be safer, quieter, and better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suicide-bomber curse people?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Franky and her goat?&#8221; Charles asked.  He smiled a little.  &#8220;If Florin Pesch had taken the Lordship and ceded it to Musser, that seed would have blossomed and seeded fruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got in the way of that, stopping Florin like you did.  But it remains a trap that&#8217;s primed.  One liable to go off soon, if the families of that area keep organizing like they&#8217;re doing.  Perhaps you could look into that when you return.  If you return.  It doesn&#8217;t matter either way to me.  My attention will lie elsewhere.  Taking Verona&#8217;s challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I <em>did</em> bait you?&#8221; Verona asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  No, for other reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona <em>did</em> know what those other reasons were.</p>
<p>Because Charles, at the end of the day, was still Charles.  If he&#8217;d taken the bait and been provoked into taking action, well, that&#8217;d be Charles too.  Alexander had taken advantage of that and gotten Charles forsworn.</p>
<p>Charles was also someone who&#8217;d fallen into another trap, though.  The friends he&#8217;d made.  The mistakes he&#8217;d made when those friends were involved.</p>
<p>He might have Maricica as a pawn, but that didn&#8217;t soothe an ongoing wound.</p>
<p>He was alone.  He was lonely.  He was here and he was appealing to them, trying to reach out.  He wanted the parents to agree with him.  He wanted help.  He wanted someone to talk to and bounce off of.</p>
<p>And he didn&#8217;t have that.  Not like he wanted.</p>
<p>Verona knew too well what that was like.  She knew that sort of loneliness, even while next to her friends.  It was there in the empty space on the couch, and it was here, in her second big Demesne claim, much of it spent without any company as she faced down enemy after enemy without any friends.  Without Jeremy.  Without Tashlit.</p>
<p>Other things, sure, but she felt like she got it.</p>
<p>Charles wasn&#8217;t taking the bait that had come with her &#8216;come on!&#8217; and everything else, her calling him out on giving up.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d taken the bait that started with Lucy saying Verona sounded like she was agreeing with Charles.  And maybe to some degree she was.  Maybe to some degree she was more okay with his plan than the others were.  And that was a big thing to unpack.</p>
<p>Not nearly as big as Easton&#8217;s thing, but still, she&#8217;d unpack it later.</p>
<p>He thought Verona might agree with him.  Like it was possible.  <em>That</em> was bait he was prepared to take.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acceptable to start?&#8221; Charles asked.</p>
<p>Verona maintained eye contact as she rubbed at her hand, nodding a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about other pressing matters,&#8221; he said.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;Avery!?  Downstairs!&#8221;</p>
<p>The call came from downstairs.  Her dad.</p>
<p>Snowdrop was busy being a goblin sage in training and an ambassador, so Avery didn&#8217;t have the lookout she often had back at the Thunder Bay house.  She had to go in blind.  She snatched her bag as she passed it, and made sure she had her spell cards.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Driscoll.  The moment Avery was in sight, Elizabeth let it out, &#8220;What the fuck are you doing with my little brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking.  We talked.  We brought him back safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gave you permission to talk to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s dad put his hands on Avery&#8217;s shoulders.  She kind of wanted to shrug her way free of it, but at the same time&#8230; no?  She didn&#8217;t want to break even the tenuous connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anyone in the backyard?&#8221; Avery asked her dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just Grumble, and he&#8217;s sleeping.  I can bring him inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s comfortable and happy, let him stay that way,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Uh, excuse me,&#8221; she said, as she moved closer to Elizabeth, easing her way outside.  She went to close the door, but her dad followed her out.</p>
<p>Right.  Complicated practitioner diplomacy with the parents watching.</p>
<p>This was still weird.  She glanced over and made sure the windows were shut.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can talk here, if you keep your voice down,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t noticed, I&#8217;m not in a &#8216;voice down&#8217; kind of mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe I should go back inside?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;And you can go to the council. Louise and the rest can explain things.  We&#8217;ll be out of the way of innocents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How innocent is he?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, looking at Avery&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you measure that,&#8221; Avery admitted.  &#8220;He knows general stuff.  No Aware grooves or anything that I&#8217;ve noticed.  Except maybe a connection to Kennet found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother may not be innocent, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can snatch him up like you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me.  It was a Foundling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You collectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either way, she&#8217;s still figuring things out, one of our residents of Kennet below asked her to see if she couldn&#8217;t find someone for us to talk to &#8211; a loner, someone on the right side.  Ten year old drawing diagrams in the dirt with a stick for fun fit the bill, I guess.  I only found out about it after she&#8217;d been sent on the errand, only found out it was Dom when he was halfway to the place I was meeting Luna and whoever she found.  Wasn&#8217;t me, wasn&#8217;t even <em>us</em>, big picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you talked to him.  You gave him a deal to bring back to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Not even a deal, exactly,&#8221; Avery replied.  &#8220;More of an offer.  We&#8217;re not asking for much here.  What we want is to get you guys out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are dangerous.  You don&#8217;t have control over your entire&#8230; element.  Kennet below, you&#8217;re <em>admitting</em> you don&#8217;t know what the other hand is doing, if you&#8217;re saying it wasn&#8217;t you, these people are acting on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have guidelines.  Rules most of us keep within.  The people involved kept to the rules.  Helping the town, not starting anything big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if something had happened?  I know for a fact you have the one faction in Kennet below who attack people, rob, steal, cause trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Stuck-Arounds?  They&#8217;re barely a faction, and they&#8217;re mostly confined to Kennet below.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if you&#8217;d been attacked by the more aggressive practitioners on our side while he was with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230;&#8221;  Avery was a bit bewildered by the question.  &#8220;We&#8217;d get bad karma, I guess, for showing poor hospitality?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not nearly good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m-&#8221;  Avery was still a little caught off guard.  &#8220;-isn&#8217;t you guys being dangerous a <em>you guys</em> problem?  Sorry your parents brought him into a dangerous area and didn&#8217;t watch him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked like she&#8217;d start raising her voice again.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s safe now though?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good you care about him,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;This world seems-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, um-&#8221; Elizabeth interrupted, raising a hand, shaking her head, and sounding not very sorry.  &#8220;-beg pardon, I&#8217;m being rude, but you don&#8217;t know.  You&#8217;re not part of this world, you just have one toe in the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery used the opportunity to get thoughts in order.  &#8220;Dom&#8217;s apparently safe, we were pretty responsible, I think, we got a message to you guys in the safest way we could without the messenger being at risk.  From your guys, who are way more out of control and, like, problematic, than our out of control problematic guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond to that.  She sat down on a stair, then put her bag down beside her.  She craned around to look at her dad, trying to think of how to handle this.</p>
<p>She knew how Lucy would handle it, and Elizabeth would probably be pissed off.  She had no idea how Verona would handle it, but it was bound to complicate things.</p>
<p>They needed and wanted peace, even if that was with someone frustrating like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let others know then.  That doing anything else with Dom would be antagonistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Elizabeth replied, tone terse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry.  It seemed like, I don&#8217;t know, Dom would get to be front and center, look good, that might be something he wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this environment, with this much going on, being front and center is a dangerous place to be.  It&#8217;s people who stand front and center who get shot first, when bullets start flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really have the guns,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be quippy or cute,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  She had to walk down a few steps to be at eye level with Avery.  &#8220;Just keep him clear of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you guys discuss the offer, at least?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  For any and all of you.  We can arrange a way for the people who are stuck doing the civility course.  If they want, anyway.  They can skip it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the cost of being fined, for skipping out on a writ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Losing something random?  Could be the nose of your face, your soul, cherished possession, key memory,&#8221; Elizabeth replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could be your left sock, penny in your pocket.  Just saying it&#8217;s an option, I don&#8217;t know what they want to do.  But if someone decides to stay to do the course, we can extend the offer to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking into it.  Looking into our own options.  But it sounds like we want to say yes.  Talked to Jessica Casabien.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s fine.  She&#8217;s stepped back in a big way from practice, since helping her cousin.  But there are others who need help, and she&#8217;s made a small business of it.  We made an offer to buy her help.  She said no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at Avery&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to mind you.  Things from deep places got stirred up.  If the Ruins are the deep ocean, then what we&#8217;re seeing is like&#8230; something down there that eats the corpses of blue whales that sink to the bottom.  Whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good reason to say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Felt like she was going to say no before that even came up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really.  Was the offer insulting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was exceedingly generous.  There&#8217;s money in amounts people retire with.  This was&#8230; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s halfway to there.  If she got all of us through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  I think I know why she said no, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much.  Too intense.  I don&#8217;t think she trusts you guys.  Then you add an amount she doesn&#8217;t trust?  Kind of a too good to be true thing, coming from people who aren&#8217;t very&#8230; true, I guess, to begin with?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded to herself, leaning into the railing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like Jessica,&#8221; Avery told her dad.  &#8220;She backed us up.  Skipped out before the end of Summer, but she helped lots before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyn and Martin say the spirit world is in a similar place.  Warrens aren&#8217;t suited to large groups moving through.  Especially the way we&#8217;d want to.  Any big group draws attention and you inevitably lose a few people in the trip.  But we&#8217;d want to split up, each of us going somewhere separate, so we&#8217;d draw that initial attention, then we&#8217;d split up so we&#8217;d be vulnerable to getting picked off.  America Tedd thinks maybe half of us would make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Faerie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have a good Fae practitioner to be a guide.  Silas is running the family business, Estrella went with Musser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d probably be the same as the Warrens, huh?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think someone who lives in a place with strong Fae and goblin presences would say something like that,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>Avery thought about saying something like &#8216;no comment&#8217; and decided against it.  &#8220;What you&#8217;re saying lines up pretty well with what Nicolette was saying.  Zed&#8217;s not comfortable transporting through the Digital Aether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure are a lot of these&#8230; places?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than humans know of,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;These are the main ones.  And you&#8217;re proposing a way out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I put out feelers, I think it&#8217;s doable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was discussion around your offer.  The sentiment is you&#8217;ve created a problem and now you&#8217;re selling- or <em>offering</em> a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles created the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Carmine Exile created the problem of the monsters out there.  But Kennet created the problem of blocking communications.  The Bugge remains an omnipresent threat, we struggle to get calls out.  We can, but every time we try, the Bugge gets a foothold.  Then you&#8217;re making an offer where you, as the sole party that can provide an answer, offer the rescue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; Avery murmured a reply, nodding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want communications opened back up.  Call the Bugge off.  Call the other things off.  We can find ways we know and trust, that get us out of here.  Our own ways, our allies and friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I get an actual reply?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could.  Will you swear?  That you and everyone that isn&#8217;t explicitly on Kennet&#8217;s side, that is currently or was very recently in Kennet won&#8217;t use the freed-up communications to mess with us, assist Musser&#8217;s efforts to take over?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wait, let me add, because I forgot.  <em>Or</em> you pledge amends, three times what we lose or suffer, three times any information gleaned we did not want you to glean, and so on.  As a stopgap, between failure of the oath and you being forsworn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we lose Kennet, you or the Driscoll family could give us three towns of equal or sentimental value, free of Musser&#8217;s grasp.  There&#8217;s a lot at stake, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t think us losing Kennet is reasonable.  And I think we&#8217;d hurt, a lot, if we gave you that.  If you don&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s that dangerous, then you could swear agreement and prove me wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of what harm is differs between my perspective and yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed upon third party mediator?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to swear that oath.  No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Avery answered.  She shrugged a bit, and kept her shoulders hunched up some.  &#8220;Then we&#8217;re not likely to give you free communication out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might help you if you do.  People are antsy.  We&#8217;re- there&#8217;s a lot of different personalities and family cultures crammed into limited spaces, and there have been for a few nights straight.  People have lost family, friends, they&#8217;ve had their lives turned upside down.  If there was <em>one</em> person like that in those cabins, they&#8217;d be a lot to deal with, tiptoe around.  You know?  But there are dozens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Powder keg,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That implies the flame hasn&#8217;t been put to the powder yet.  There have been blow-ups.  Anger, frustration, debate.  Old rivalries and inter-family divides from decades ago resurfacing.  There&#8217;s no patience.  Not for each other, not for the wait for critical information,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you some info.  I can give you more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if that would make things better or worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you take the info and you decide?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery held up a finger, then got into her bag, pulling out the laptop.  It took a second to boot up.</p>
<p>She exhaled heavily.  &#8220;I&#8217;m in contact with Nicolette.  A bit with Zed.  Because of the sheer amount of reports we&#8217;re getting, the Black Box isn&#8217;t really enough.  That&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s a system a practitioner called Rad Ray Sunshine made.  It keeps track of the more dangerous Others, the places you have to watch out for.  No-go zones.  It&#8217;s also for sharing information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old interface doesn&#8217;t work.  It marks out areas in red and different colors, and you click one and it gives you an info box and a link to where you can look stuff up.  But there&#8217;s some dense areas, especially around the cities, where you can&#8217;t even click on stuff because there&#8217;s so much overlapping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can click on the city name, to-?&#8221; Elizabeth stopped talking as Avery shook her head, pitching the statement as a question.  &#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turns out if you have five overlapping things in one area, it won&#8217;t bypass to let you click the city name, so you have to do weird camera stuff sometimes, if that even works.  Even with that, if you do get to the city name, you zoom in, see the city broken up into regions, and&#8230; too much, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Ray will be glad that more than five percent of practitioners are using his tracking system,&#8221; Elizabeth mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that many more are using it.  I think even with just the five, maybe ten, <em>mayyyybe</em> fifteen percent, it&#8217;s still too much for the system to conveniently help with.  Nicolette&#8217;s working on a ticket system with Zed, kind of a side thing, to attach to the Black Box, and sort and prioritize what&#8217;s there.  She&#8217;s hopeful that people will engage with it and provide information if they know it helps make them a priority.  Lets the Augurs know what to emphasize, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And put a higher price on,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might be off base,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m reminded of something similar at work, my boss was trying to get the employees to use the work wiki to track documentation changes.  It was like pulling teeth, and we had total code spaghetti in places, with no idea who to ask about certain implementations&#8230;  After cutting back on work for as long as I did, homeschooling you guys, I definitely wanted that wiki working, felt his pain.  He tried doing things so his devs wouldn&#8217;t work on something unless it was clearly documented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I got all that,&#8221; Avery admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know how I feel,&#8221; he said, with a half-laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, how is that relevant?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  It didn&#8217;t really work.  Everyone had too much to do, their own deadlines to meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think people won&#8217;t use Nicolette&#8217;s priority system?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  Maybe they will, because it sounds like life and death&#8230; except the older I get, the more I think people don&#8217;t pay enough heed to even the life and death stuff.  Or especially that stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same with us,&#8221; Elizabeth said, sighing.  She looked at Avery.  &#8220;And?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the work hasn&#8217;t really budged.  Um, one second.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery texted Nicolette.</p>
<p>The replies usually came back pretty fast.  Nicolette kept her phone in arm&#8217;s reach while she worked.</p>
<p>She made a call.</p>
<p>The call, at least, got picked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end.</p>
<p>Avery shook her head, looking over at Elizabeth.  &#8220;Someone picked up but-&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The voice was male, breathy, smooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, is this Seth?  Or Chase?  Or-&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;No.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Not any of those.  Then-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Avery Kelly.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice kept interrupting her, so she kept her mouth shut.  Elizabeth moved closer and Avery put the phone on speaker phone.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We would insist you join us for tea, Ms. Kelly, but I&#8217;ve been told to leave certain things alone.  It would be such a shame for you to miss out.  If you invited yourself, I&#8217;m sure it would be fine.  Or would you like to host us?  All you need to do is say the word.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Elizabeth reached for the button to end the call.  Avery beat her to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not planning to say the word to him,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, because I think that&#8217;d be a good way to die, or worse.  Do you have an open space for me to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I- not really?  Dad, is the car in the garage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just&#8230; no questions?  Emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go.  I&#8217;ll hit the button.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went inside.  Avery got her stuff and went around the house toward the garage.  As they were halfway down the driveway, the door opened.</p>
<p>The floor was flat and concrete.  Elizabeth immediately started drawing a circle.</p>
<p>Avery admired the ability to draw a circle and have it be that round, just by hand.</p>
<p>The circle went into a square.  Straight lines too.  Then at the corners, Elizabeth made some notes.</p>
<p>Avery tried Zed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No answer from Zed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s dad came down the driveway.</p>
<p>The notes were phone number, postal code, latitude and longitude, and then a neat little chalk drawing of the Blue Heron Institute&#8217;s logo.</p>
<p>The inside of the circle began to fill with chalk.  The chalk mapped out the Blue Heron Institute.</p>
<p>Elizabeth crossed the diagram, sat on her heels, and drew a line parallel to one side of the square.  The line disappeared nearly as fast as she&#8217;d drawn it.  The image shifted, centering on the central building.</p>
<p>An eye shape followed by a line- that disappeared fast too.  The image zoomed in.  The constant work of the chalk drew out the interior walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Close that?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>Avery looked at her dad, and he stepped inside.  She hit the button to close the garage.</p>
<p>Things were illuminated with only the old lightbulb and the light that seeped in around the side door and beneath the big door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you put the laptop down, flush with one side of the square?  Opposite me?  And your phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery did, before sitting down.  With all the unused and old bikes mounted on the one wall, waiting for various kids to get old enough, and the snowboarding and skiing equipment, she had to make sure not to lean too far back and bring any of it cascading down on top of her.  Not that it was a real problem, probably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other reference points help clarify the image.  Uhh, wish I had more on me.  If I had the things from the cabin&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could go if you need me to.  Or could I be a point of reference?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were kind of expelled, so no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn.  I could run to the cabin.  If you&#8217;d swear I&#8217;d be safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was that on the phone?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer later.  Just let me&#8230; Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery got into her bag, found the little binders with the old investigation notes.</p>
<p>The letter and printed out class list from the Blue Heron, and the map.</p>
<p>She placed those down along another edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;Means I don&#8217;t have to spend as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached into a pocket and pulled out a folding knife, then unfolded it.  She held her hand over the diagram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; Avery said.  She moved around, then sat at one face of the square.  She put her hands at the edge.  &#8220;As guardian of Kennet, in the interest of protecting one of Kennet&#8217;s allies and friends, I ask that power be put toward this effort.  Let Elizabeth Driscoll guide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dad was watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can just donate power like that?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;  Elizabeth used the knife and sliced the backs of her fingers, between first and second knuckle, then let the blood drip down.</p>
<p>Red added accent and color to the image.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend and foe,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;Let blue blood drip for friend, let red blood drip for foe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood dripped.</p>
<p>As it did, little moving dots appeared on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh wow.  You got us more than halfway there with words alone,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the point, or even in the top ten reasons I&#8217;m fighting so hard, but if Musser took over, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to anymore,&#8221; Avery murmured.  &#8220;It&#8217;s probably in Verona&#8217;s top ten reasons.  She likes the magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dots illustrated what was happening.  Three red dots came down the hallway, at a lazy pace, and a fourth circled around the school.  The blue dots were in a cluster together.  They were moving toward the library, but as the red dot came inside, they stopped and went into the kitchens instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the tea party bogeymen, we think?&#8221; Avery asked.  &#8220;Mention of tea, the numbers&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth pointed.</p>
<p>Two more had just appeared.  Western wing.  One of the rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming from Nicolette&#8217;s room.  That&#8217;s her desk.  I need to use your laptop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead.  Do you want me to move it, or-?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was already on her feet, moving around.</p>
<p>Avery looked back at her dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Factions, bogeymen, strange worlds, and <em>this</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a year since I last did technomancy, give or take a few weeks or months,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;And your laptop&#8217;s not set for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinda freaky you can spy on people like this,&#8221; Avery noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, normally.  But we were consulted at one point for the school layout.  Bristow&#8217;s addition.  We got some permissions, in exchange for promises.  Kind of like what you wanted me to swear.  I think I can make the argument that it&#8217;s an emergency, special circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not sure?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicolette&#8217;s a friend.  It&#8217;s worth the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure,&#8221; Avery answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I get webcam access?  I use a different brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery got up and hurried over, pressing the button combination, minimizing windows to get to the desktop icon.</p>
<p>&#8220;And- the call, okay, same program I use,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  She dialed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Zed&#8217;s number, right?  I tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zed&#8217;s number, but different extension.&#8221;</p>
<p>The screen flickered in a way that made Avery think it was going to break, then resolved into an image of a face, overexposed.  It took a bit to clarify.</p>
<p>Nina.  Zed&#8217;s Librarian Animus.  She was backed by what looked like fifteen overlapping notetaker applications that scrolled at different rates, each filled with writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nina, is Zed okay?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t looked.  Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Invading Others at the Blue Heron.  They&#8217;re coming through the computer.  I know you have access to the library computers,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, but I made certain deals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With emergency provisions?  Like I did with the planning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apply the provision.  I can&#8217;t move the laptop around without distorting the image, but I can swear to you that at the current moment, I am looking at a map of the school, red dots for enemies, blue dots for allies.  Nicolette and the other Belangers are on the defensive, retreating, while Others close in on them.  It may be the same for Zed.  They&#8217;re coming from the computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get me access to the computer.  Relay what I&#8217;m doing.  Give me a clear picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Text okay?  I work best with text.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fast reader.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As everyone should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery sat back, nervous, watching as the text scrolled on, describing various things, programs, and files.</p>
<p>&#8220;Close that.  Move that aside.  Tell me if it changes.  Close that.  Close that.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a <em>lot</em>, but Elizabeth quickly narrowed it down to three programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Invitation to tea,&#8221; Avery said, pointing.  &#8220;They <em>insist</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth typed some more.  <em>Cordially refuse your invitation to tea, it is frankly callow and bullish if you are to insist anything, given where things stand and your treatment of prior guests</em>.</p>
<p>The message apparently went through.</p>
<p>Then it reappeared, with an error message struck across it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re technomancy Others?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  But they&#8217;re a big enough presence they&#8217;re bleeding into other spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the Hungry Choir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, maybe.  I wasn&#8217;t part of that.  Let me focus?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shut her mouth, watching.</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried two things.  One was code.  It didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>The other was a shorter command.</p>
<p>The red dots disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That worked,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>Elizabeth exhaled.  Then she sat back up.  She picked up Avery&#8217;s phone, and when she did, the chalk diagram distorted, then scattered, becoming a blurry smear.  &#8220;Zed.  Text him.  Copy down what I wrote.  Kill, space, BB, dash, RRS, extension, zero-zero-thirteen, set, one-six-one-five, all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery showed Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that stops whatever&#8217;s after him?  Kills them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  But it tells him what he needs to stop them.  He&#8217;ll know what the command is for. Now we wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Black Box.  Putting them into the system, they were marked as enemies,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;I think they&#8217;re rigged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rigged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rule-based, instanced bogeymen, they respond primarily to triggers, rituals spread around as urban legends, usually.  Say the right words while sitting around a candle with your friends at a sleepover, get murdered, that sort of thing.  Except here, based on what they were flowing from, it&#8217;s a bit different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles got crafty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you call them an enemy, especially in text or- I&#8217;d believe it works with any hostile practices firmly aimed at them, they&#8230; respond.  They have the right to invite you to tea first.  And you don&#8217;t survive tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aim the wrong practice at them and before you can use it, they interrupt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More appear behind you, grab you, take you to tea.  The Black Box software declared them a priority threat, opposition.  I think the Lordships, any Lord is going to end up saying hey, you&#8217;re not listening to me, I&#8217;m going to have to deal with you if you won&#8217;t obey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At which point it&#8217;s a declaration against them, they get to respond by first inviting the person to tea&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or asking the other person to host them for tea.  But I don&#8217;t think I know any practitioners who are good enough to be Lords but stupid enough to offer to host a random Other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>Avery turned.  &#8220;Oh, hmm.  Host as in parasite and host.  They&#8217;d possess you or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>The phone rang.</p>
<p>Avery picked up.  &#8220;Zed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey.  Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth did most of it.  You okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut up some.  I can heal with practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Brie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s fine.  Tougher in these situations than I am.  She fought them pretty hard, bought me time to get my phone out of my pocket and type what I needed.  What the <em>fuck</em> was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zed,&#8221; Elizabeth raised her voice a bit to be heard.  &#8220;Thirty bogeymen.  They respond to provocation, declarations of war, ill intent, that sort of thing.  That command only kills that one entry, you have the credentials for that.  But if anyone takes it on themselves to re-enter the information on the thirty, it&#8217;s going to happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they go after that person?&#8221; Zed asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Because anyone and everyone using the Black Box counts as a person tacitly agreeing to call them enemies.  They can go after anyone using it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck.  The Blue Heron?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Already covered that.  But I don&#8217;t know about anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray is going to be <em>so pissed</em>, fuck.  The project was already a nightmare for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it helps, but I think it was explicitly designed to mess with this sort of thing.  Any project that works well enough is going to get negative attention.  People should understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gotta go.  Thanks again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck!&#8221; Avery called out.  She wasn&#8217;t sure if she got the word out in time as Zed ended the call.</p>
<p>They sat back.  She checked her phone, looking for Nicolette, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing after another,&#8221; her dad said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s probably not the only trap Charles set,&#8221; Avery said, looking over at Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were theorizing about that.  We were also wondering who is affected, who is protected, who might be collateral damage.  It seems you&#8217;re safe, huh?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ask to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Musser&#8217;s on that list too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He got out safe and he&#8217;s been mostly unobstructed, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery got to her feet, picking up her phone and laptop, and moved them somewhere safe, before opening the side door of the garage.  She cranked on the water, and unspooled the hose.</p>
<p>Grumble was on the back porch, sleeping, like the world was going on like normal.  And her mom was at the window of the kitchen, peering through, out toward the back yard and the garage.</p>
<p>Avery shot her mom a smile, and got a bit of a smile in return.  Then her mom stepped out of view.</p>
<p>She gave the hose a test squirt.</p>
<p>Nothing came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  I turned it off for the colder weather.  Here,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>He turned something inside the garage, and the water flowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>She checked with Elizabeth, then sprayed the diagram down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to the others,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;Maybe if we present this as a trap, instead of an attack, it could change the mindset around it.  Something of the Carmine Exile&#8217;s design, meant to snare us, that we need to think around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to them about your escape route.  It&#8217;d help if I knew more about what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paths.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paths.  Okay.  You think that&#8217;s out of Charles&#8217; reach?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty darn sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one taking us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.  Probably.  I&#8217;ll figure it out, figure out the best way to go.  Then I&#8217;ll give you instructions, walk you through it.  But this can&#8217;t- I can&#8217;t do it if I&#8217;m going to get ambushed by America for a fourth time, or if people are going to be idiots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run it by them.  Might be a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I get out of here?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, before motioning to the side door.</p>
<p>The button was partially hidden by things hanging from the ceiling.  Her dad reached past it to bang it.  The garage door opened.  Chalky water ran down the driveway.</p>
<p>Elizabeth walked away, checking her phone.  &#8220;Frick.  Battery low.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she broke into a run.</p>
<p>Avery took her time getting the hose put back, sorting out her laptop, and checking to see if Nicolette had any messages.  The old compost bin was in the corner of the garage and served as a stand for the laptop.</p>
<p>There were notices on the Black Box, warning about the thirty bogeymen without referencing them directly.  And the ticketing system had a bar at the top.</p>
<p><em>There may be slight delays in Belanger contract fulfillment due to injuries.  We ask for your patience.</em></p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t know Wye&#8217;s number to call him.</p>
<p>Lucy was talking to her mom and watching over the situation in the city, handling the front lines while Avery was at the flanks, keeping track of their various allies and stuff.  Avery would go out on patrol later, maybe.  Verona was handling her Demesne.</p>
<p>She thought about earlier, and dozing off with the virtual equivalent of having her head in Nora&#8217;s lap, and having Nora be happy about it, and that was a little bit of a recharge in the face of all of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you saved lives just now?&#8221; her dad asked, startling her a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess.  Didn&#8217;t really think about it.  I didn&#8217;t do that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were pretty cool.  Scary stuff, but cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to be the way a lot of this goes,&#8221; she replied, quiet.  Little dribbles of cold water had run down from the handle and down her sleeves, and it was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you were saying about oaths before.  Pretty cool.  I was- I remember, back when you had your bad patch, near the start of the year?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  The lonely patch at school.  It had technically been from fall onward, but still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worried you were going to withdraw too far.  Be too passive.  Hearing you be assertive like that?  A lot of this scares me, but I love that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped over and hugged him, hard.  He hugged her back.</p>
<p>They went back inside.  Avery paused as she saw her mom in the kitchen, still, fussing around leftovers.  She had a moment to watch as she kicked off her wet shoes.</p>
<p>The house was quiet.  Aunt Clara and Aunt Tracy and Uncle Sean had left with the rest of the kids.  Grumble was sleeping, Declan was playing his games, Kerry was drawing quietly at the dining room table, and Sheridan was lazing around somewhere.</p>
<p>Her dad went to her mom, hugging her.</p>
<p>Avery ventured into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our daughter&#8217;s pretty cool,&#8221; her dad was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that already,&#8221; her mom murmured back.  She turned to look at Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, honey.  Will you be eating at home this evening?&#8221; her mom asked.  &#8220;We still have the baked ziti.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for doing that.  I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;ve got to make a phone call, figure some stuff out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Speaking of figuring things out, I don&#8217;t know how to bring this up or- I don&#8217;t want to scare you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to think of a way you&#8217;d scare me away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the plan?  I understand what you&#8217;re doing is important&#8230; as much as I understand any of this.  Louise did a good job of explaining a lot of it.  But for right now, our lives are on hold.  Do we go back to Thunder Bay?  Can we?  When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Avery answered, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got work.  You all have school.  And I know how it sounds, when there are&#8230; crises.  Dangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>She edited her words and volume so Kerry wouldn&#8217;t hear in the next room.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;I wish I had a clearer answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we set the agenda, loosely, for tomorrow morning?&#8221; her mom asked.  &#8220;First thing?  Up at six thirty, in the car by seven thirty, three hour drive gets us back by ten thirty.  You get sorted, back to school at noon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would give us a free hour to clean up after Rowan, after any megahuge party he threw,&#8221; Avery mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not funny.  I&#8217;d go overboard.  I&#8217;m- I&#8217;m really trying, Avery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to take this in stride, and absorb it, and everything, trying to <em>breathe</em>.  I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s dad took her mom&#8217;s hand in his own and kissed the back of it.</p>
<p>Avery swallowed hard.</p>
<p>Nightmare situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry.  I&#8217;ve been kind of ass, handling this,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not around your sister,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>And her mom laughed, that nervous laugh that jangled Avery&#8217;s nerves.  Like all the stuff she was holding back came out in this panicked little laugh that was anything but happy.</p>
<p>Kerry looked over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep drawing.  Show me later, okay?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Kerry nodded, and resumed drawing with more intensity, filling spaces in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Avery told her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I love you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  <em>But you have to</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I adore you.  I cherish you.  I&#8217;m proud.  I&#8217;m torn up we didn&#8217;t do better by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to say that,&#8221; her mom whispered.  &#8220;We put you in the background enough you were their first choice for someone vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you also raised me okay enough I- I have strengths.  Stuff I&#8217;m good at, that lets me do okay at this.  They originally planned for us to be total boobs, total idiots, making mistakes, just&#8230; nobody people who wouldn&#8217;t shake the boat too much, wouldn&#8217;t enslave them, would fill the seat and let them say, hey, we have people on the job already.  No need to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom shook her head, looking like she was going to talk twice without actually getting to the point of getting words out.</p>
<p>Finally, on try number, three, she said, &#8220;In the movie- I don&#8217;t know when we watched it.  The kids went exploring, urban area, found a dwarf who made them super toys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I saw that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw it with your younger siblings.  But it&#8217;s- I think of that movie a lot.  How angry the parents got.  It&#8217;s so stupid.  They weren&#8217;t- they weren&#8217;t real people.  There was just the one thing, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not making sense.  Am I making sense?&#8221; her mom asked her dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only the dwarf, and the little enclave of dwarves that was on screen for a few minutes, and that was it.  That was all they had to figure out.  Then they figured it out, and life went back to normal.  Normal life, but the dwarf helped the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  Yeah.  Standard formula, huh?&#8221; Avery asked, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried I can&#8217;t figure this out.  And that there&#8217;s no normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like biology,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s still parts and things they don&#8217;t know how it all works, Mr. Lai said.  There&#8217;s still things in physics, particles.  People spend their entire lives trying to advance human knowledge, what, point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent forward, in one subfield of a field?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t- I&#8217;m not-&#8221; her mom started.</p>
<p>Avery saw the squeeze her dad gave her mom&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got enough on your shoulders,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll work on the me part.  Please tell me you&#8217;ll be safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if there&#8217;s- anything concrete you can give me?  Schedule, plans.  Ideas about what I can do to help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get yourself sorted.  Let me know as soon as you know about dinner.  And if plans change and tomorrow morning won&#8217;t work, let me know as soon as possible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you go without me?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Nightmare.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  But we&#8217;ll have to figure something out.  Maybe talk to that council Louise mentioned.  Because if they really truly can&#8217;t do this without you&#8230; something needs to change.  Jasmine said as much and I have to agree with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s dad nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery went upstairs to get sorted out, put the laptop aside, because she didn&#8217;t want to get it crushed if she got ambushed again or anything, and then grabbed her running shoes with the runes on them from her luggage, moving quietly so she wouldn&#8217;t disturb Sheridan&#8217;s nap.  She also changed out of the top that had gotten wet from the hose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Need help getting blood out of clothes?&#8221; Sheridan murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?  No, I&#8217;m good, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme know,&#8221; Sheridan said, before turning over.</p>
<p>Venturing downstairs, she overheard her mom.  It sounded like she wasn&#8217;t far from the stairs.  She and her dad had moved away from the dining room where Kerry was drawing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the future looks like anymore.  We could plan the day.  We could plan for the kids to go to college.  We could plan around work and careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t plan around this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll work it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery made a deliberate thump as she went down one stair.  The conversation below stopped.</p>
<p>She sat on the bottom stair to pull her running shoes on and lace them tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not making that phone call?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it while I&#8217;m out,&#8221; Avery said.  She grabbed her bag, deer mask attached to the outside of it, then went to the door.  &#8220;Love you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love you,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you so much.  Stay safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery flashed a tight smile, then headed outside.</p>
<p><em>I took the future from</em> <em>her.  The plan</em>.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t sure how to fix that.</p>
<p><em>Send me cozy thoughts</em>, she willed Snowdrop.</p>
<p>Snowdrop sent her cozy thoughts.</p>
<p>Then, a block away from home, she made the phone call.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell did you do?&#8221; the person on the other end asked, gruff.  &#8220;Open Pandora&#8217;s box?  What the hell is happening in your neck of the woods, Avery Kelly?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a little taken aback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just kidding.  You <em>didn&#8217;t</em> have anything to do with the stuff I&#8217;m hearing about, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not directly, Mr. Garrick,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit.  &#8216;Not directly&#8217; is a lot closer to responsibility than I would&#8217;ve thought when I made the joke.  You okay over there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s messy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like.  Any chance you can tell us how things went?  Jude&#8217;s keeping quiet and I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;m three seconds from snapping and grounding him for the better part of today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t.  Please don&#8217;t.  Things went okay.  He was a big help.  Sorry that we did that so last minute, I know it was messy with the family politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say another word about that.  That&#8217;s on us.  Okay?  Things went okay?  Just okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Founding worked.  It&#8217;s pretty cool.  I&#8217;m not sure it was the magic one-shot solution we hoped it would be, but&#8230; it worked.  Jude was instrumental- no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No I mean&#8230; Jude was <em>heroic</em>.  So do whatever the opposite of punishing him would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I screwed up.  Don&#8217;t put that on him.  He- he was great, he was super.  But things were chaotic, I was rushed, I&#8217;ve been rushed for a while, one crisis after another.  I let him down.  I let you guys down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not- I&#8217;m not some superhero, you know?  I&#8217;m not the next Hazel, achieving anything like walking the Paths for a hundred years.  I&#8217;m just- pretty normal.  I got lucky enough to have power from how I came to the practice, lucky to have some talent, maybe, a good mentor.  Jude was closer to being a superhero, this weekend.  He stayed when I had to go.  He helped me through the Paths.  And he did some of that after I let you guys down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jude&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re okay,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You called for a reason.  And I don&#8217;t think that was to puff me up any.&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was really hard to read.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to puff you up.  I really am grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it helped.  But what do you need?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I- I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sure?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I wanted to call to sound you out.  Something like eighty practitioners crashed our town, to support a big Musser Lordship claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy shit,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty-something still around.  I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re in bad shape and I shouldn&#8217;t even be calling to ask for information and advice-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do, Jude?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Avery insisted, at the same time Jude said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said, sounding unconvinced.</p>
<p>&#8220;-I don&#8217;t know if I shouldn&#8217;t be calling, if I&#8217;m okay to call for the advice, if I&#8217;m taking these people onto a Path, which Path might be best and safest for one-time travelers, maybe.  Except I&#8217;d have to run it a bunch of times, to take different people to different destinations.  If I didn&#8217;t take them all to the Blue Heron.  Or&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or if I&#8217;m okay to offer a business opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What opportunity?&#8221; Jude asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you guys want to do it?  I owe you guys.  I owe you a lot-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to gainsay you, but I don&#8217;t see how you do,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she said.  <em>Jude said I had to repay some of what I got</em>.  &#8220;If there&#8217;s a cost involved, let me shoulder some of it, and then some.  If that means I&#8217;m in your debt, okay.  I&#8217;ll work on it over the next while.  But we&#8217;d be looking at getting sixty people in&#8230; I think we counted thirty cars.  Possibly thirty different destinations.  You&#8217;d come, pick them up, take them, and go.  And I&#8217;d cover some of the costs, taking it on as debt, plus some extra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jude,&#8221; she heard Mr. Garrick say.  &#8220;You know more than I do, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this about owing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this about you bringing back Max&#8217;s things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say we do it,&#8221; Jude said.  &#8220;Take the offer as it stands.  Consider this like&#8230; like the negotiation.  How Clay stood in.  Got privileged information, said to take the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on the other side of it, I&#8217;d say, s&#8217;far as debt goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to go too overboard,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;Some ways Paths get priced, like us running an errand to look for something lost, if we multiplied it by thirty, we could own her for life.  Don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Jude agreed.  &#8220;But go a little overboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to drop this on you, Jude,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery ran her fingers through her hair, heart heavy in her chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t suppose we could squeeze out a marriage deal?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a relationship,&#8221; Avery replied.  &#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t rule anything out.  Live your life, get life experience, then when you turn eighteen-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be gross, dad,&#8221; Jude said.  &#8220;Times have changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels like I&#8217;m in a weird spot in this conversation,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;Between you and Jude, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the worst thing in the world,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;My boy, getting his head into the family business, working this stuff out.  This isn&#8217;t a small job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we in a position to move thirty groups through the Paths?&#8221; Jude asked.  &#8220;You&#8217;re in a position to answer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have to ask the others.  Family politics.  If I agreed to something this big without consulting the family, <em>again</em>, someone might consider hiring a hitman to remove me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, uh, let&#8217;s not risk that,&#8221; Jude said, voice soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think yeah.  I think, just talking business, if these groups- sixty something people, if they can&#8217;t figure out a good way, but we think the Paths are clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit world&#8217;s got hazards that gave a top shaman pause, same with Ruins, Warrens have problems, it&#8217;s a lot.  It&#8217;d be nice if we could scout it, make sure that the Carmine Exile hasn&#8217;t screwed something up there too&#8230;&#8221; Avery trailed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of his jurisdiction,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  That was my thought,&#8221; Avery agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If moving around&#8217;s a difficulty, they&#8217;re in a pinch, and we&#8217;re the only good way they have of moving around, maybe that&#8217;s an advantage to us.  So let&#8217;s give them a <em>real</em> cheap trip, this one time.  Get them out of your way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Ideally, please.  The getting them away part more than the cheap part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might rustle up future business for us.  We can try making ourselves available.  It&#8217;s a good opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me talk to the family.  Gotta play politics.  Might be they ask for money, or for more from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d like to make this a little easier on both of us.  Let us see this Founded place.  We can make notes, see what we can learn.  Bit like a Path, but without as many worries.  Give us a writeup?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can do.  It&#8217;s pretty tame.  But you&#8217;ll want to get a pass, and you&#8217;ll need masks.  Or any face coverings that were face coverings first and foremost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like a plan.  I&#8217;ll be in touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The call ended.</p>
<p>Avery wanted to let out a huge breath, but she had to take one in first.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She broke into a jog, going to rendezvous with Lucy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>It was evening.  Avery&#8217;s stomach was full of leftover baked ziti, and she couldn&#8217;t even pass on the feeling of satiety because her mom had snuck Snowdrop some.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re losing the market,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America&#8217;s a celebrity to goblins.  Especially in this area.  If we can&#8217;t shake her, get things to calm down, then we might end up with more local goblins against us than local goblins willing to try the market thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help you there,&#8221; Snowdrop said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do a bit,&#8221; Lucy replied, &#8220;but as much as the goblins might adore you, America&#8217;s got you beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The goblins hate me a lot, actually.  So abusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope we&#8217;ve got this worked out,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;If she shows&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>They were partway down the street when she saw her parents with Jasmine.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure you want to do this?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Bringing them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bit too late to say no, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasmine looked tired.  Which kind of matched her to where Lucy and Avery were.  And her dad seemed okay, but it was okay in a hard to read way.</p>
<p>It was like&#8230; she&#8217;d spent her entire life with her dad.  For a lot of that time, he&#8217;d just been her dad, and her teacher.  She&#8217;d never spent the time really thinking about who he was, or what he was about.  Not until she&#8217;d come out.</p>
<p>It hadn&#8217;t just revealed who she was to him.  It had also given her her first serious look at who he was.</p>
<p>And it hadn&#8217;t been a clear look.  The reality of it hadn&#8217;t settled in right away, until she&#8217;d been in that house without her mom, Sheridan, or Rowan.  Because he was hard to interpret or anticipate.</p>
<p>Her mom was easier.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing this?&#8221; Jasmine asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inside,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inside?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>They walked inside.</p>
<p>Avery put her bag down.  She opened it, then pulled out the wooden masks.  &#8220;Had to shop around, put in a special order to get this done fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deer mask for her mom, unpainted, it was just wood, and burnished an orangeish color.  Her dad&#8217;s mask- she had to pause and screw in the antlers.  A slightly darker tone to it.</p>
<p>Lucy had a fox mask for her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the same masks as before, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shook her head.</p>
<p>They donned the masks, tying ribbons where necessary.  Snowdrop grabbed onto Avery&#8217;s arm, became an opossum, ran across her shoulders, down the other arm, and hopped down, landing in a squat, wearing a different outfit, wooden opossum mask included, with its mouth open in a silent scream, teeth bared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have your ID?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We drove, so of course,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think we&#8217;re good to go.  Miss!&#8221; Lucy called out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss!&#8221; Avery called.  She saw her dad move his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss!&#8221; they all said.  The parents joined in, Avery&#8217;s mom a half-beat late in realizing the others were saying it.</p>
<p>The lights shut off, came back on bright, and blinded them momentarily.  The brightness faded.</p>
<p>The layout of the house had changed slightly, to accommodate the way down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought it would be fun to try that,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said, voice muffled slightly by his mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dork,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Foundlings were out in the street as they ventured outside.  Avery waved at the woman with the toddlers in helmets like something from an endgame boss in one of Declan&#8217;s games.</p>
<p>Together with Lucy, she drew a circle on the ground.  It was something from one of her books, and some Finders and Path Runners used stuff like this, working it into a Demesne or somewhere in their workshops.</p>
<p>Exits from a Path could have a lot of possible destinations.  Falling Oak Avenue tended to deposit the finder on a street or road labeled &#8216;Oak&#8217;: Oak Blvd, Oak Rd., Oak Drive.  If someone wanted to exit Falling Oak Avenue and their town or whatever didn&#8217;t have an &#8216;Oak&#8217; anything, then it would send them to the nearest town that did.</p>
<p>This diagram could help with that, allowing certain markers.</p>
<p>The Path <em>here</em> was a little nastier, and put people in the way of something that was going to bite them.  Wolf.  Nearby hunting ground with bear trap right under their foot.  Something rabid.  Furious patient in a mental hospital.</p>
<p>Doing it like this, she could include a circle at the border of the larger circle, write down a language in a script from some language in India she didn&#8217;t know, and then place down some chattering teeth from the toybox back home.  She cranked it, then sent the pre-written text.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Garricks, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve helped me out a lot, they&#8217;re helping us out here.  Things are a bit tense and weird with Jude.  I mentioned that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Briefly,&#8221; her dad said.  &#8220;I talked to your mom about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmmm, they&#8217;ll arrive any second, but if they talk about marriage&#8230; don&#8217;t agree to anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh what?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Practitioner thing.  Inter-&#8221;</p>
<p>The first Garrick appeared.  Jude&#8217;s dad, zipping from sky to circle in half a second.  Dust and moisture lifted off the ground for half the block, making everything appear momentarily hazy.  The chattering teeth bounced into the air, and caught on one of his fingers.  He was wearing the pilot&#8217;s cap with earflaps, with a yellow scarf around his lower face.</p>
<p>&#8220;-marriage.  Jude&#8217;s dad.  Cliff Garrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jude&#8217;s mom, a brother or cousin, sister, and Jude himself all appeared.  The teeth bounced between them as they made their appearance.</p>
<p>Then other cousins, including Lance, and Adorea, then uncles, the uncles&#8217; kids, Luca and Finn included, and a couple of aunts all appeared, filling the circle.  The teeth broke on the last arrival.</p>
<p>Fifteen in all.  It looked like they&#8217;d color coded the scarves by family branch.  Jude&#8217;s grouping was yellow, others were blue, red, and white.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, let me say, exceptionally weird to dismount from a Path, and end up somewhere so&#8230; Pathlike,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels like we did something wrong,&#8221; Lance said.  &#8220;Little heart stopping moment.  Like missing a stair, but existential dread instead of smashed-face dread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s mom said.  She approached, putting hands on Avery&#8217;s shoulders.  &#8220;Lovely.  Congratulations.  I&#8217;m so glad your ritual worked well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So are we,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p><em>This is going to blow up.  The secret about what Miss did, or my mom&#8217;s going to lose it, or someone&#8217;s going to attack and a Garrick will get hurt</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kelsey Kelly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Esme Garrick,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s mom said.  Avery&#8217;s mom had offered a handshake, which led to Esme letting go of Avery&#8217;s shoulders to properly answer it.  Which might have been the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m told you recently became aware?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose?  I don&#8217;t understand much of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m happy to tell you everything you need to know.  If that&#8217;s alright?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s appreciated,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>Esme glanced at Avery, who nodded once.  They&#8217;d laid that out in advance.</p>
<p>There was really not a lot left to preserve, as far as Innocence went.</p>
<p>&#8220;To start with, you do know your daughter is excellent?  We&#8217;re all fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery chuckled nervously, taking the opportunity to duck out and around that little conversation.  To Jude&#8217;s dad, who was right there when she circled around, she said, &#8220;Thank you for coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy to help.  Look at all this, huh?  Look at this.  You didn&#8217;t aim for anything small, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t have been easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m going to say hi to the rest of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery had established that in advance too.  That she couldn&#8217;t play favorites.</p>
<p>Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter was the big one.  White scarf.  He had been the guy who was meant to be next head of the family.  At least, until Jude&#8217;s dad had started making nice with Avery.  He was also the one who had sent Jude&#8217;s cousin Adorea on the trip to the Stuck-In-Place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming, Peter,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>He took her hand in both of his, shaking it.  In the process, he passed her a business card.  &#8220;Happy to help.  I&#8217;m told you consider the debt the Garricks owe paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Concluding our first official business,&#8221; he said, holding onto her hand still.  &#8220;Call me.  Talk to me about the Cakewalk, and our next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, about that,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;As a token of goodwill.  For us concluding our first official business.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The solve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not perfect, apparently, but it&#8217;s mostly reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; certainly a token.  Thank you.  It&#8217;s said by some that it&#8217;s bad karma to engage in an unequal deal.  Something for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  I&#8217;ve been clumsy, asked for last minute help, or forgotten things, or upset the family, or disrespected someone or something, and I hope this makes up for that.  Save some lives, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting us closer to the official Promenade complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That too.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Miss got Max killed in self defense, and I kept it a secret.  This is about that upset, that forgetting, the disrespect.</em></p>
<p>Jude apparently thought it was better that they all didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Snowdrop ran off, and Avery turned her head, looking.</p>
<p>Snowdrop tackle-hugged Luna Hare, &#8216;biting&#8217; her in the neck with the mouth of the open opossum mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re terrible,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Luna!&#8221; Avery greeted her.  &#8220;You can identify our families by the masks, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can manage,&#8221; Luna said, trying to look prim and proper while also trying to get Snowdrop to unlatch from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And these are the Garricks, who I think color coded themselves by family branch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So noted.  I&#8217;m to be your guide.  Not that you need one, but we&#8217;re trying to build relationships,&#8221; Luna said.  She leaned more and more right, bringing her right shoulder closer to the ground as Snowdrop &#8216;bit&#8217; her, then finally pushed Snowdrop away, the nose of Snow&#8217;s mask catching on the edge of hers as they parted.  Snowdrop stumbled a few steps away and laughed.</p>
<p>There was a hint of a smile on Luna&#8217;s face as she pulled her mask down.  She pulled her bag around front, and opened it up.  &#8220;Papers.  Permission slips.  If you&#8217;d take one when I call your name?  Peter Garrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man Avery had just been talking to took one.  Avery had passed on word ahead of time, that there should be an order.  Jude&#8217;s dad had agreed to it.</p>
<p>Making nice, making sure they didn&#8217;t feel like they were being constantly demoted in favor of Jude&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reece Garrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finn and Luca&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cliff Garrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from there, partners, then by declining age.</p>
<p>Finn was the last.</p>
<p>Luna looked very satisfied as she finished, as far as Avery could tell with the mask there.  She ducked low into a curtsy, hand out.  &#8220;If I may?  I&#8217;m told we have a schedule to keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;If there are no questions?  Or anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything we need to know about rules, special qualities of this place?&#8221; someone asked.  One of the other family heads, maybe.  The wind stirred around him and not the people near him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to eat, tiredness will affect you differently, you could stay up indefinitely without needing to go to bed,&#8221; Luna Hare said.  &#8220;Gets a little tricky because it&#8217;s always night.  I use the television schedule.  I like to wake up to certain shows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have TV?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And radio.  And other things.  I&#8217;m happy to take you on a tour through our downtown area later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna continued on as tour guide, leading the way.  They moved as a group down the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goggles keep fogging up,&#8221; Adorea said.  &#8220;Dad took the good ones and these aren&#8217;t making a seal against my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have run Up In Smoke,&#8221; Peter told her.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a boon for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A boon?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>Jude&#8217;s dad explained, &#8220;Along the way, an Other will blow smoke into your eyes.  Leaves you mostly blind.  Five to ten percent of your vision left.  But once you find your way through, the most something can ever blind you is that same number.  Five or ten percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds fantastic.  Why doesn&#8217;t everyone do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed.  Why <em>didn&#8217;t</em> you do it, Adorea?&#8221; Peter asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what was that?  Do tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a movie.  Ride Shotgun.  It was pretty good.  Friendships are important too, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know.  But I also like the fact I can see even with my goggles fogged up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to borrow the eyeliner?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I?  Will I be okay removing a goggle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe step off to the side and ensure nobody sees?  Make sure you don&#8217;t walk by a window or someone overzealous might take offense,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy had turned to smoke, and scaled up to a high place.  She walked on a series of connected balconies parallel to the path they were taking.</p>
<p>Then a few younger Finders did similar things, jumping up or going to high places, leaving it as Luna Hare, the adults, Avery, Snowdrop, and two older kids on the ground.  And Jude.</p>
<p>Lucy looked a little miffed, Avery thought.  That she&#8217;d gone off to keep watch, and they&#8217;d flocked after her.  Or copied her.  And now there was no point.</p>
<p>Not that there was a <em>lot</em> of point, when Kennet found being Kennet found meant they couldn&#8217;t be attacked.  Allegedly.</p>
<p>Miss was there on the horizon, sitting on the peak of the ski hill, paperwork on her knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kids look healthy and happy,&#8221; Jasmine noted, looking around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>Luna Hare said, &#8220;Kennet found is great for your health, as you can get plenty of rest, you don&#8217;t need to eat, and you can prioritize <em>you</em>.  It&#8217;s a safe place.  We&#8217;ve already made deals with Kennet below, to take in a few of their less able and elderly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the oldbodies, I hope,&#8221; Lucy said, from directly above Luna.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Why does everyone keep saying that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they&#8217;re super nice and too good for this place,&#8221; Snowdrop said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kennet found is <em>very</em> nice, actually,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a balance, the kids,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible balance,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;School, proper training, magic things, gradually warming them up to face two entirely different worlds.  The human world and all of this&#8230;&#8221; Jude&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s even possible for a child to be fully prepared to face the human world,&#8221; Jasmine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did a pretty good job with Booker, I hear,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear that from Lucy?  Because she&#8217;s a little biased,&#8221; Jasmine said.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Booker is a treasure, I&#8217;m immensely proud.  But he&#8217;s had wake up calls about what the world had in store for him.  A tough first semester.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stand by the idea that if everyone in the world was more like Booker, the world would be in a great place,&#8221; Lucy said, a little haughty, or affronted.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is he?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen.  He&#8217;s off at University.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have one that just finished.  Jude&#8217;s oldest brother.  We pay him to draft texts we sell to the practitioner community, he&#8217;s putting the money toward a home, allegedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allegedly,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad stressed.  &#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  So long as he puts up with us when we ask for help configuring the television systems, I won&#8217;t ask too many questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jude&#8217;s silence felt like a crushing weight on Avery&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>Sucked.  Really sucked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make them learn first aid.  But that&#8217;s good for any kid to know.  Especially active ones,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter was telling Jasmine.</p>
<p>But as much as the <em>Jude</em> situation sucked, her mom was talking to the family.</p>
<p>That was part of why she&#8217;d made the extra push to do this.  Before talking to her mom, she&#8217;d intended to just <em>maybe</em> ask for advice.  Or to call and leave a message.</p>
<p>But her mom was floundering, wondering what the future looked like.  And Avery figured this might do.</p>
<p>She hadn&#8217;t really accounted for the effect of the more active part of the Garrick clan all showing up.  There were a few absent she might&#8217;ve recognized if she&#8217;d seen them, like the old man who&#8217;d helped at the Promenade, but eh.</p>
<p>What she saw was a gradual change.  Super gradual.  Every sentence was like, one percent difference.  Her mom relaxed a bit.  Seeing that this family was still a <em>family</em>.  Seeing them have the same concerns.  The same worries about what this world had in store for them.</p>
<p><em>I want to get past the bad crap.  Then maybe there&#8217;s something similar to what these guys are doing in my future</em>.</p>
<p>How in the hell was she meant to get past the bad crap?</p>
<p>They each had a job, and in the chaos of it all, they hadn&#8217;t had a great opportunity to chase that down.  Avery was meant to find allies for Kennet.  Lucy was meant to find someone who could take the Carmine Throne.  Verona was meant to find a solution.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;d taken some small steps.  This, for Avery.  Lucy had made friends with more goblins and Dog Tags, establishing a network.  Verona had come up with the idea for Kennet found, and done the legwork in setting it up.</p>
<p>But it felt less like progress and more like they were fighting like hell to maintain a position in the midst of a situation that was changing and evolving.  Holding onto friends when it looked like they were going to pull away.  Making more alliances with possible Carmine contenders, while others died and left.  Coming up with something to give Charles and his sanctuary less of a foothold in Kennet, while he put his master plan into effect.</p>
<p>Even in the other goals.  Like keeping family intact.</p>
<p>This was less a step forward, and more a move to hold onto her mom, before all the magic garbage and America&#8217;s shitty stunts did any real harm.</p>
<p>But it was at least working okay.</p>
<p>The big family dynamic was, like, <em>home</em>.  It was familiar.  They&#8217;d <em>just</em> sent their family away.  That was good, and Avery hadn&#8217;t expected how good it would be.</p>
<p>The reassuring voice.  The- just having people she could introduce her mom to, that didn&#8217;t come with horrible caveats like Toadswallow having a dangerous and vulgar side, or Miss being responsible for&#8230;</p>
<p>Avery struggled to encapsulate it in her head.</p>
<p>&#8230;For a lot.</p>
<p>Luna led the way, prattling on, though it seemed only a few were listening and taking notes.  Snowdrop periodically tried to mess with her, taking her hand and making her spin while walking, or poking, or trying to make her laugh, or getting junk food and holding it out for Luna.  It was like Snowdrop&#8217;s natural disposition for chaos drove her to natural, light antagonism with prim, orderly Luna.</p>
<p>That, or she&#8217;d spent too much time around goblins.</p>
<p>Avery hoped some of Luna&#8217;s style would rub off on Snow.  It&#8217;d be nice to have a sweet familiar.</p>
<p>Her mom laughed, and it wasn&#8217;t a nervous, high-pitched laugh.</p>
<p><em>Please don&#8217;t ruin this</em>, Avery thought.  <em>Please don&#8217;t let anything screw this up</em>.  <em>Don&#8217;t attack, don&#8217;t fight, don&#8217;t let secrets come out, don&#8217;t let Kennet below riot, don&#8217;t let the wrong people stumble in.</em></p>
<p>She tapped her shoes three times, then leaped up to where Lucy was.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mom&#8217;s doing okay?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ready for this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea.  How are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanting this done with.  It&#8217;s good to have you here, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I&#8217;m probably leaving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  It&#8217;s good.  Be where you need to be.  But it&#8217;s nice while you&#8217;re around.  Verona does this a lot.  I know it&#8217;s not her fault right now, she&#8217;s gotta do the Demesne claim, but when it&#8217;s not that, it&#8217;s something else, like she&#8217;s doing alchemy, or in the Undercity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could tell her you miss her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I worry it&#8217;ll be too needy, and it&#8217;ll push her away.  Because that&#8217;s a thing, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to have someone else around, when she&#8217;s not.  But at the same time, I&#8217;ve had no time for Wallace, and it feels shitty, because I was <em>just</em> giving him flack for ignoring me after his surgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for sure.  I told Nora I&#8217;d be back.  I get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We gotta arrange a double date, somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would that even look like?  You taking Wallace to Thunder Bay?  Because I think bringing Nora to Kennet would be, uh, fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you just very pleased with yourself, texting me to say you had your head in her lap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By phone.  Kind of!  Super great moment.  I have Snowdrop to thank for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy chuckled, face hidden by the mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell if Luna wants to murder Snowdrop by now or if she&#8217;s having fun with a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> want to murder Snow sometimes.  Snow!&#8221; Avery called out.</p>
<p>Snowdrop stepped away from Luna.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go opossum mode and go easy, or come up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop went opossum mode, crawling on Luna.  Just the fact she was there and crawling along her arm and shoulder seemed to do more to break Luna&#8217;s attempts at giving a good tour than all her antics as a human.</p>
<p>They walked along the rooftops, jumped down to cross the bridge, then went up to more rooftops to stand watch while the parents and Garrick adults walked and talked, with a few Garrick adults taking notes from Luna, or walking around the edges of the group and taking notes on Foundlings.  There was one guy who looked like he was being obnoxious, talking to Foundlings who wanted to get on with their night, so Avery hopped back down.</p>
<p>As they got closer to the valley, Miss turned, then came down from the ski hill.  She shrank as she approached, and there was a resulting effect that made it seem like she wasn&#8217;t getting a lot closer.</p>
<p>Until they reached the sidewalk that bordered the black grass that led into the valley, and Miss was just a few paces away.  Leaves and bits of black grass stirred, along with Miss&#8217;s black hair, creating an illusion that made it feel like any drift, movement, or fixed placement of the eyes on a point of Miss&#8217;s face would reveal something.  It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss, I gather?&#8221; Jasmine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jasmine.  A pleasure.  Mr. and Mrs. Kelly.  Garricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk.  I know now isn&#8217;t the time, but I do want to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I find you, at a quieter time?  It&#8217;s hard for me to leave, but I can make some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our Promenade solver?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad asked.  &#8220;Avery Kelly&#8217;s source?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mentor,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; Miss said.  &#8220;I provided information on the Cakewalk as well.  I know a little more.  I&#8217;m happy to talk later, if you want to make a return visit.  We can modify your passes, allowing second visits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have so much to ask,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;But we have work to do, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery looked past him to Jude.</p>
<p>Jude, who was quiet, mostly ignoring Adorea, except to answer questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can talk again,&#8221; Miss said.  &#8220;The Garricks and myself, myself and Jasmine.  Mr. and Mrs. Kelly, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much that&#8217;s too important,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;Put us at the bottom of the priority list, but don&#8217;t forget us, how&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Shall I take you over?  I&#8217;ve glanced, and kept an eye out.  I think we&#8217;re reasonably safe.  Luna?  I know you wanted to stay away from the main group.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay back,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I fill out a memo?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a way of thanking her.  Earns her a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery took the paper from Luna, and filled out the various spaces in the form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good explanations, can I fill one out as well?&#8221; another Garrick asked.</p>
<p>Luna happily handed over the papers.  The Garricks who&#8217;d taken notes filled out the forms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.  You&#8217;ve been very kind.  Good luck.  I hope your trips to the Paths go well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna hurried off, back toward the houses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you&#8217;re ready?&#8221; Miss asked.</p>
<p>They got together as a group.</p>
<p>And the wind stirred, the grass picked up, and so did the little specks of seedling from the tallest, almost wheat-like bits of grass.</p>
<p>Some got in Avery&#8217;s eyes, making her blink.</p>
<p>When her eyes opened, she was looking at about twenty-five practitioners.  Her bracelet ticked madly to tell her she was being watched from the one direction.  They stood down in the valley, looking up.  None looked <em>especially</em> happy.</p>
<p>Avery glanced around, but nobody was up and awake, paying enough attention to see that people had materialized from nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty.  Four undecided and observing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It looked like Cyn Gaspard was one of the undecided.</p>
<p>Fence-sitter in the problem solver vs. conflict practitioner divide?</p>
<p>Twenty was less than half of the sixty-something that were still in Kennet.  Disappointing.</p>
<p>But at least they hadn&#8217;t been attacked the second they&#8217;d appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a debate, and the uneasy agreement we came to was that if they can&#8217;t cooperate, they should stay behind,&#8221; Mr. Martin said.  Sal&#8217;s dad.  The spider breathing shaman.  &#8220;We agreed it would hurt inter-practitioner relationships if they interfered, they should leave and let us meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was complicated.  Some have familial or friendship ties to people you&#8217;ve captured for the three or seven days,&#8221; Elizabeth&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;But you&#8217;re okay?  We&#8217;re good to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re eager to get home, and to see what we can do to fix what&#8217;s broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to introduce you to the Garricks, at least those of you who don&#8217;t already know them or know of them.  They had working relationships with Mr. Belanger and Mr. Sunshine.  They&#8217;re friends of Edward, which is apparently a big City Magic name out in Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were some nods.</p>
<p>Avery looked at Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could group up by intended destination?  We have fifteen available and willing tonight.  If you have more than fifteen destinations, some will have to wait,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter told the assembled group.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the price?&#8221; Mr. Driscoll asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covered by Ms. Kelly and Kennet as a whole,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad answered.  &#8220;If you ever wanted another trip like this, we tend to start at ten thousand.  Doubled if it takes longer than an hour or if you want a Path boon while you&#8217;re at it.  Tripled if there&#8217;s danger before the Path or at the post-path destination, tripled if you&#8217;re requesting a dangerous Path.  Multiplicative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re looking to do business with us in the future?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re open to it, assuming good behavior,&#8221; Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter said.</p>
<p>The discussion continued.  Different groups feeling each other out.  Jude had walked over, and Avery hadn&#8217;t not noticed.  Jude touched her arm, and she followed him to the side and away from the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s twenty-four out of sixty-something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a lot for a long time.  I tried to explain that, before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hinted at it even before then.  Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Jude.  I really am.  It was really great of you to not refuse to talk to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you talking me up to my family.  Did you mean for me to hear that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed you heard it.  I just thought&#8230; I really really didn&#8217;t want to put you in a bad situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They watched the adults interacting.  It sounded like they were talking oaths, for extra security, on both sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sucks, not being able to message you and complain about my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so behind on messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured.  It&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty awesome, that Lost town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Found, technically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, sure.  But it&#8217;s also a Lost town.  Sounds better too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery grunted, in a &#8216;nyeh&#8217; sort of way, without outright refusing or disagreeing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to convince my family you&#8217;re not the next Hazel, you gotta calm down and stop pulling stuff like that or handing out solves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave your uncle the-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw.  It&#8217;s good.  Thanks for following through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to maybe getting a chance to calm down.  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening here though.  In Ontario.  The various attacks.  There was a scare earlier-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jude!&#8221; Jude&#8217;s dad called out.  &#8220;Listen for this part!  You&#8217;re taking one group!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gotta go,&#8221; Jude said, sighing.  He took one step, then paused.  &#8220;We&#8217;re okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s totally up to you.  I screwed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re okay, I guess.  I get it, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.  I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe call me a hero to my dad again.  I imagined sparks flying off his brain at trying to process that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery laughed a bit.</p>
<p>The talk about locations, who was going where, and other things carried on.  The invading group was debating internally about how dangerous the destinations were, and if they should establish a precedent about that, for future billing.</p>
<p>Which made it sound like there was future billing, which was great.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shall we go first?&#8221; Jude&#8217;s Uncle Peter asked.  &#8220;Taking one small group?  And we can call the Kennet group and they can pass on the message?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were nods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Rhys Garrick, I gainsay you, for fifty-three days, for fifty-three falsehoods made.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group parted.</p>
<p>He was at the back.  Charles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you contest?&#8221; Charles asked.  He stood there, red, regal in a messy, raw way, like a king of old might&#8217;ve been, rather than a modern king, wearing red beneath a heavy fur coat, beard and hair thick, eyes crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the <em>fuck</em> are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words felt like they would&#8217;ve come out of Lucy&#8217;s mouth, but they had come out of Avery&#8217;s, instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;My duties,&#8221; Charles said, calm.  &#8220;We&#8217;re overdue for a talk.  Let&#8217;s converse, before this goes any further and I find myself noticing more people overdue for a thorough gainsaying.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/wild-abandon-18-3/"><strong>Next Chapter</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<p>Scattered branches, rocks, Lost spirits, and a tattered scrap of curtain were caught in the conflux.  Lost things, unwanted and unseen, on a realm that sat on reality&#8217;s furthest borders, that were certain to go unrecognized, unimportant, and untouched even if thousands of people were to traipse through the realm.  They were Lost things even among other Lost things.</p>
<p>Scattered ideas, faint impressions, and half-formed thoughts could be Lost too.  An emotional moment became an echo, which was pulled together from impressions and ideas, and among those ideas was a background memory that had never truly found any footing, nor crossed into the mind&#8217;s eye.  It&#8217;s one of the first scraps of echo to pull away as the echo later disintegrates.  But much like wisps of smoke can dissipate into the air or happen to hold together to ascend higher, the dissolving echo of a partial and unimportant memory holds together.</p>
<p>The universe filters things like these, with active agents, like the typhlotic entities of the Ruins, who form an ecosystem to clean the Ruins of echoes and echo-scraps, but this scrap is in an area of the Ruins that is thinner than most, with the Electro-Radio Aether slowly overtaking this particular area in the handling of memory, principles, and the dead.  It is an imperfect adaptation thus far, and the scrap escapes both Ruin and ERA.</p>
<p>Once it reaches a place where neither realm has sway, it reaches Nothingness.  The bounds of reality.  To an outside observer keeping a close eye on the scrap, it seems to skip between places, as it grazes different ones, because one cannot travel across Nothing.  It cannot easily disintegrate because there is nothing for it to disintegrate <em>into</em>, no place for fragments to go.</p>
<p>In a sea of jigsaw pieces from different puzzles, with different purposes, for different audiences, pieces from different puzzles can accidentally match, and it becomes a kernel of something Lost.  A few scraps cling to it, and that disintegrated, travel-worn, fleeting echo of a memory that has not yet <em>fleeted, </em>lucky or unlucky enough to not be digested by the universe and repurposed, it attaches to colors and shapes and becomes something Open to Interpretation.  A part of Lostness, of the furthest outreaches, of Path.</p>
<p>It has its own gravity and its own stickiness and in traveling through Paths it eventually sticks to one that is quiet and patient with many hidden things, where a thing that is Open to Interpretation that is mostly white and light and hidden is not out of place.  Much like a cloud could be seen by one person to be a dog and as a lion by another standing on the next rooftop over, it is both these things and neither.</p>
<p>And so it remains for some time.  No force acts on it and it acts on nothing.  It is unimportant, unassuming, unmoving, untouched, unrecognized, unwanted, unseen.  It is surrounded by millions of other such things that have formed in similar and different manners, ranging from the ancient to the new.</p>
<p>Until a Lost woman drops a piece of paper with a diagram on it.  Conflux and connection reach out.  Things as light as fall leaves tremble and stir slightly, moving closer.</p>
<p>And, some time later, a greater diagram is drawn and the woman says final words to a boy keeping her company, and then steps through.  She has a marked destination, creating a clear line for her to travel, and she is surrounded by anchors to that reality.  Those anchors give her a grip and a weight.</p>
<p>Then it is fed with power from a distant battery, and that weight multiplies a thousandfold, producing a gravitational weight that then multiplies a thousandfold again.</p>
<p>The unimportant scrap of memory is pulled through with her, alongside one of those anchors.  She is followed by a flood of things that had insufficient grip on the Path where they had rested, adjoining Paths, and things she had a stronger connection to.</p>
<p>The boy remains behind, but some Lost join her, falling after.  A ballerina with her face turned perpetually away, a soldier, a woman dressed in moonlight.</p>
<p>The Lost woman at the forefront accumulates Lostness around herself as she falls, at the same time she builds up reality, grows steadily in scale.</p>
<p>With so <em>much</em> swirling about, it is easier for the jigsaw to find the pieces that neatly interlock.  With the leading Lost woman&#8217;s intent and the focus on the destination, there is intent and focus in how things are being put together.</p>
<p>The branches and rocks, Lost spirits, and tattered scrap of curtain gather around the little lost memory.  The things that were Lost even compared to the Lost things of the Path are drawn together with that kernel that is so Open to Interpretation.</p>
<p>In the chaos, any observer must blink, flinch, turn away, and when they do, or when an object obstructs their vision, that kernel has taken shape.  Still vague, the scrap of curtain wraps around the vague shape within, masking it.</p>
<p>The Lost woman crashes through the moon, escaping from within it.  The sky changes in the wake of it.</p>
<p>Again, as moon-rocks fly by, vision is obstructed.  Some bits become parts of the puzzle where every piece is from somewhere different.  The scrap of lace curtain is now a dress, the moon rock is now form, and the thing that is Open to Interpretation gets a moment of recognition from the Lost woman, and in that moment it is interpreted.  It is now a person, and that person is bound to the Seal of Solomon as her creator was, because her creator was.</p>
<p>The clouds part, the destination becomes clearer.  The diagram stretches upward and outward, funneling them, and in the crash, the destination could be transformed into virtually anything.</p>
<p>But three locations are marked out.  Like mirrors giving a view of the location from different angles, they focus the intent, making the destination clear.</p>
<p>The Lost woman hits ground first.</p>
<p>The three locations make it so the town remains a town, and they act like rocks near shore, breaking up the intensity of the waves that are transforming the destination.  Mundane items act as other rocks, broadly distributed, turning what could have been a tidal wave into an incoming tide.  Power still overflows, but it reaches the perimeter, shrines shored up by the power from the battery from earlier.</p>
<p>Luna approaches from an angle odd enough that the peak of the roof doesn&#8217;t meet, curving wildly before striking the bed.  She bounces off, crashes into headboard, lamp, and bedside table, before landing with her back to her little bookshelf, two books falling atop her.</p>
<p>She is quick to stand and get herself in order, hoping nobody saw that little disaster.</p>
<p><em>Won&#8217;t do that</em> <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>The thought finds its way into her being, which is still in the process of being interpretation.  Even as she stands, she can feel her self awareness and memories falling into place, like enough meteors striking from the skies that they form mountains and other shapes.  The thought and self-commitment becomes an important one.</p>
<p>This is her place.  It is hers and hers alone.  It is seen as important that this little realm that was just Founded is fantastical and odd.  So she is a child with no parents and a house to herself, and just down the street is a house with thirty babies within as the primary tenants, with adults who come in every morning, noon, and evening to feed them and sort things out.  Next door is a couple who never work, and next door to them is a family that chases down hare-brained business ideas, often with two or three overlapping, working themselves mad trying to keep it all together, with improvised factories and deliveries always ongoing.</p>
<p>Luna walks over to the window, and she sees the Founder at the horizon, busy at work making the rules.</p>
<p>Then she looks down and sees people on the arching sidewalk below, by a significant drop to the road.  Which makes it more of an above-walk than a sidewalk.  Or a catwalk.</p>
<p>People who are violating the rules.</p>
<p>She hurries, getting papers from the table by the door, in her hurry.  She does not have to work herself mad, but some pocket money would not go amiss.</p>
<p>That is who and what she is, the existence she has Found.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Luna sat up in bed, removing her rabbit-themed sleep mask and putting on her other mask in the same motion.  Then, after a brief stretch, she made her bed, and headed outside, to where a reflection of the moon sat squarely in the middle of the rain barrel that had caught the runoff from the gutters, which themselves caught the runoff from next door.</p>
<p>She moved her mask up and kept it just above the surface of the water as she dunked her head beneath, then straightened, shivering and shaking her head.  Moonlight and water soaked her in equal amounts, and it was <em>cold</em>.  Obviously, since the moon wasn&#8217;t known for being especially warm.  She rinsed her arms and washed up, hair catching the light of the moon, clothes brightening a bit as well as that light soaked in, much as the water did.</p>
<p>By the time she was back upstairs, she had her hair partially done up, half left down, still damp, half bound up into two cone-shaped bundles up at the top and front that sat flush with the ears of her mask.  She dressed, aiming to look snappy, brought her messenger bag downstairs, and made a little breakfast, with the television turned to edutainment.  Omelette with carrot.</p>
<p>Part of this place being fantastical was that there was no school.  But being studious and smart was part of who she was, and she was glad there was something like this to compensate.  It was much like how the law was scattered, a bit of responsibility, civic responsibility, and self-governance given to each of them, or how fire was the responsibility of the neighborhood to manage and plan for.</p>
<p>It was open and free and that only made the laws all the more important, to protect the weakest and most vulnerable of them, and the whole of them.</p>
<p>Which got her to remember- she collected some milk bottles and put them in the same container the milkman had delivered them in.</p>
<p>On her way out, she placed the milk she wasn&#8217;t going to get around to drinking on the welcome mat of the baby house further down the street.  She saw a little baby&#8217;s hand reach out through the doggy door at the front, reaching for a bottle, and nudged the bottles closer, until the hand got a grip on one bottle and pulled it through.</p>
<p>She nudged the little container around to move the other glass bottles closer, and three more hands reached out, working together to drag it through, producing a dull &#8216;clunk&#8217; as they bumped into the floor on the far side.</p>
<p>Luna skipped off.</p>
<p>The Founder was downtown, looming over the slightly taller buildings.  Which was convenient and exciting.  Luna picked up speed as she ran, waving at some of her neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful!  The invaders are still in town!&#8221; an old woman shouted.  She had a pretty woman&#8217;s face painted on a veil, and in the right light and at the right angle, if Luna squinted a little, it looked like her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pulling a kid out of a vent on the side of the house.  A little boy, with a cloth hood over his head, an angry old man&#8217;s face painted over her own.  The moment he saw Luna, he hauled his jeans down to moon her, showing her he&#8217;d used some of the mask-paint on his buttocks, painting nipples on the cheeks and a leering face on his lower back.</p>
<p>His grandmother hauled the jeans back up with enough haste that she probably did some inadvertent damage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, dear!&#8221; the grandmother called out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright.  Is your daughter alright today?&#8221; Luna asked.  She&#8217;d walked by so now she walked backwards to keep addressing the woman.  &#8220;She&#8217;s wearing the baby face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes such a fool.  Doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s doing.  Then tomorrow she&#8217;ll be wretched and I&#8217;ll be the fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you find a balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do be careful.  Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turning in some slips!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be safe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna was far enough away now it was easier to wave than to shout.  The boy with the old man face had yanked his trousers down, showing how he&#8217;d painted his frontside too.  She supposed it was meant to be a wild animal or monster.</p>
<p>On her way to the records building, she saw someone&#8217;s head sticking partially out of a barrel.  A moment later, that barrel was rolled toward a set of stairs by a pair of older boys with helmets.  She dashed forward before it could reach the stairs, then leaped atop it.</p>
<p>She walked backwards to match the forward roll of the barrel, staying atop it, as it made its way down, then carried on as it rolled down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; the boy in the barrel said, in an off-kilter way that suggested he was <em>very</em> dizzy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; one of the older boys said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I walk with, Hogsy?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do.  Just stop me by&#8230; over there.  The drain.&#8221;</p>
<p>She carried on walking backwards, helping the barrel to roll.  It was a unique quality of hers that she was very good at balancing, and a unique quality of the barrel that it was very good at being balanced on.  Staying on top of the rolling barrel was easier than walking on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>There was a drain with a decorative cover on the road, disappearing into a space beneath the sidewalk, and she centered the barrel by it before bringing things to a wobbly stop, balancing on top.</p>
<p>Hogsy poked his head out and vomited.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t immune to the nausea and dizziness that came from being in a rolling or tumbling container.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good to continue?&#8221; she asked, when he&#8217;d stopped.</p>
<p>He burped, poked his head out to look at her, then wiped his mouth.  He wore a ceramic pig mask that was too small for him, the part at his chin and lower lip attached to the upper part by elastics, so he could open his mouth.  He wiped at his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he finally said.  &#8220;Slow at first?&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved them forward, still atop the barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going downtown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shops,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll part ways with you a block ahead, then.  The old granny with the maiden&#8217;s face was saying it&#8217;s still dangerous.  We&#8217;re pretty safe here, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  They&#8217;re ringing the bells and singing for the dead, later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be there.  You ever think about leaving your barrel, Hogsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeps me safe.  Keeps things simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>They reached the bottom of a flight of stairs.  At the same time they arrived, a pair of burly men arrived, each wearing what looked like excavated teddy bear heads over their own faces.  One had a plank of wood over one shoulder, bowed by the weights on each end- an old man on one end, in front of him, and two kids on the other end, behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up?&#8221; the other one asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Hogsy said.</p>
<p>They each took hold of one end of the tipped barrel, then lifted, with Luna standing on the length of it, between them.  She could see the beady black glass eyes of one of the teddy bear heads, and through it, dark and distorted like a view through a fishbowl, she could see the man&#8217;s thick bushy eyebrow and an eye with deep wrinkles around it.</p>
<p>She looked away to be polite, hands clasped behind her back, while they carried her and Hogsy up the two flights of stairs that would take them up to the raised downtown area.</p>
<p>As the bear-headed men put him down, he put a hand out and flipped a coin.  One man caught it.  He flipped another out of a hole in the side of the barrel, and the other man caught it.</p>
<p>She opened her messenger bag, got some papers, and shuffled through to find a memo, but one large hairy hand interrupted her, placed over the page while she was mid-sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need,&#8221; one of the men said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s money, and it&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The pair went on their way, leaving her balanced on the barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saves us time if you don&#8217;t have to issue the memos,&#8221; Hogsy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t talked about a lot, and things were still brand new, in a way, but there had clearly been an effort made to make this a relaxed and easy place.  The writs weren&#8217;t a concern for the residents, people were taken care of.  There was incentive to be good, and incentive to work, but it wasn&#8217;t made a big deal or a focus.</p>
<p>It cost nothing to issue a memo for a good deed, and the memos could be used as a kind of currency, or turned in for a less kind, more meager currency.  It was better to hold onto them and use them without turning them in, usually.</p>
<p>Not that she had existed like this long enough to see it in action, but that was the design of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we part ways here.  Down this street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh,&#8221; Hogsy said.</p>
<p>She hopped off one corner of the barrel, and hip-checked the barrel to keep it from spinning too far.  Then, foot on one side of it, she gave it a firm push.  The sidewalk slanted slightly downhill, so he rolled on, a few people jumping to get out of his way.</p>
<p>She passed shops and places to eat, the little restaurants touting the benefits of eating there, and furniture stores that ranged from the sleepy to the overly active.  One had someone peeking out the door, looking around, and then quickly rearranged the display window to cater to her and some other people that were walking over from the opposite direction.  She paused politely to view the dresses and things that were displayed in her style and size.</p>
<p>Perhaps later.</p>
<p>She hopped onto the uneven top of a chain link fence as she reached it, and used her natural balance to stay on top, hands behind her back, a thirty foot drop to her right.  Balance was easy for her, owing to a little bit of lingering stickiness from whatever she&#8217;d been before, and this was effortless.  If she tried, she could stand so she was standing on a wall like she could stand on the ground, but that required a lot of <em>really</em> careful balance and it was easy to fall.</p>
<p>Every time Luna passed under a decorative bridge on her way to the records office, the Founder seemed twenty percent smaller.  Then she passed under one, and the Founder wasn&#8217;t in view.  She knew she was close.</p>
<p>Very convenient.  She jogged forward, bag bouncing against her hip, cushioned by the layers of the dress she wore, and pushed her way through the front door.</p>
<p>Various Foundlings were in the building, which had a hollow center, meaning that she could see each floor from the reception area in the middle.  Pages poured down from above, were gathered and sorted in a central area, boxed or bound hurriedly into tomes on counters and benches, placed on carts, and carried off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Slips to turn in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good job.  Just up the stairs there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hurried up the stairs, and paused as she saw a practitioner in the line, leaning over the counter.  The receptionist was a woman with a hood over her head, glowing eyes and painted lipstick the only things visible, and she leaned away, clearly uncomfortable with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just came from there!  I was told to come here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you got an aggravated writ while you traveled.  Five or more writs, and you need to get a statement of acknowledgement.  And it seems you&#8217;re a repeat offender, you received writs, left, came back when you had full knowledge of the writ system, and violated the rules?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <em>choose</em> to come back!&#8221; he raised his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are trying to work, sir, and you&#8217;re holding up the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not <em>people!</em>  You&#8217;re props!  Soulless, pointless, unimportant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a repeat offender, you&#8217;ll need to go to the Arena to complete a civility course.  They have an expedited three day program and a seven day program where you&#8217;ll need to show up every day for a check-in, but you&#8217;ll have the rest of the day mostly free to yourself, to enjoy the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna Hare nodded to herself.  All very sensible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck this area!&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna stopped nodding to herself, a bit affronted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your intention to annoy me to death!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.  My intention is only to help keep things moving along smoothly.  If you find this business annoying, you can hopefully come to empathize with how we feel when you intrude on our spaces and impose your rules on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not just a prop.  Whatever made you forgot to give you a two or three digit IQ, so you&#8217;re a <em>moron</em> of a prop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like a stamp on your hand sir?  That&#8217;ll give you time to get to the Arena and register for the civility course.  Once you do, all deadlines will be paused except for the thirty day master deadline.  You really do want to-&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust his hand out, almost in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;-be clear of here by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waggled his hand.  &#8220;Fucking stamp me already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I&#8217;ll stamp as soon as you&#8217;ve calmed down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not calming down!  I&#8217;m pissed!  Virtually anyone would be pissed!  And stop using that tone of voice with me, it makes me want to tear my ears off and stuff the canals with the torn-off bits!&#8221;</p>
<p>She held the stamp up and away, head tilted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stamp me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you&#8217;re calm.  May I suggest ten deep breaths?&#8221;</p>
<p>He practically snarled as he turned and left, hand unstamped.</p>
<p>Then he turned around again, pushing past Luna, and pushed all the papers and things off the top of the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I&#8217;m afraid-&#8221; the woman said, at the same time Luna called out, &#8220;Sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to glare at Luna.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; Luna asked, looking past him to the woman working the desk.  The woman gestured, seemingly happy to have Luna take over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interference with people at key duties is a writ, as is disturbance of order,&#8221; Luna told him, glancing at the paperwork on the ground.  She quickly penned in some details.  He went to take a step to get around her, and she took a step to her left to get in his way.  &#8220;And so is fleeing while being issued a writ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed and eaten rabbits before, little girl.  Do you want me to swear an oath, right here, right now?  Do you want me to bleed you like I bled those rabbits, then cut you, belly to throat, and pull your skin off?  <em>Try</em> giving me one of those papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And threats.  That&#8217;s a fourth,&#8221; she said, penning down the detail, checking a box, and putting an &#8216;x&#8217; on the recipient&#8217;s space.  She tore out the four papers, then pushed them into the practitioner&#8217;s chest.  &#8220;Gosh, that&#8217;s a full afternoon worth of running around.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved his hand, catching the papers before they could fall, staring her down all the while.  He looked like he&#8217;d jump her and do the bleeding and cutting thing right here, with dozens of witnesses, if he could.</p>
<p>Then he stormed off.</p>
<p>She watched him go until he was pushing his way out past the front door, then went and helped a few others pick up the paperwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221; the woman at the desk asked, as she got paperwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, me?  Luna Hare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;ID?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna fished it out of her messenger bag.  It was actually the first time she&#8217;d seen it.  Fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;ID&#8230; AAAA, AAAA, zero-zero-zero-zero, AAAF.  Number six, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that important?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Means you&#8217;re technically older than nearly everyone here.  At least, as a person.  There might be one or two around, maybe, and the Founder upstairs, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do for you, Luna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got some slips in the mail, things to turn in, completed writs.  And I guess I can claim the writs I just issued?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You absolutely can.  I can sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sorted things out, Luna got her wallet, and took the colorful paper bills.  It was more than she&#8217;d expected, even if she discounted the bonus that had come from issuing the writs just now.  The smallest denomination had a little goblin on it.  The next highest denomination had an opossum.</p>
<p>Money was nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I be bothering the Founder if I took a peek?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be alright.  But only if you were observing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna smiled behind her mask, then skipped off.</p>
<p>The stairs were convoluted, and the way to the top floor involved a puzzle.  She had to touch a piece of one painting, moving an apple out of frame, where it became part of the wallpaper, rolling over into another frame.  Mouse went for apple, something moved out of the way to get the cat the freedom to go for the mouse-</p>
<p>And the wrought-iron dog worked into the lock of the gate lunged for the cat, pulling on the chain.  The chain cranked, and the guns that were worked into the wall and spaces between books in the little stairwell all receded or pointed skyward.</p>
<p>She turned the handle, and let herself through.</p>
<p>The Founder was there, surrounded by flying papers that were stirred up by the wind from the skylight and the open window, and Luna could look at things from a certain angle and see how the Founder had a presence that was big enough that if there wasn&#8217;t a big enough skylight above her, it would be awkward to be indoors.  The papers were blank, and restocked by a few employees of the Records Office, with fresh stacks of white paper and paper with interesting borders and occasionally papers of interesting colors, but they got picked up, whirled around that <em>presence, </em>and picked up words when they were out of sight.</p>
<p>Then they went past the railing and downstairs.</p>
<p>Some got caught on the railing, though, pressed there by the wind, but not quite making it down or through.  Which made her think of an existence before she existed, if that made sense.  Like how people above talked about having past lives, if her edutainment shows and radio were any indication.</p>
<p>Luna ventured forward, picking up some of the ones that hadn&#8217;t made it downstairs.  Some were information pages on Foundlings, like a big phone book, some were procedures and offices, others were particulars on rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can leave those where they are,&#8221; the Founder said, without turning around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  Thank you for being helpful,&#8221; the Founder said, even while her assistants turned and shot annoyed looks at Luna- when she could see their faces past their face-coverings.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re ideas I haven&#8217;t fully committed to.  I put them up there as a placeholder, and I let them through if I change my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna put them back against the railing, and onto the floor, as best as she could remember, spacing them out so they were all readable.</p>
<p>Some slipped through the railing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was me, not you,&#8221; the Founder said.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you need anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, uh, I just wanted to watch.  And say you were doing a good job, Founder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss.  Call me Miss, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how good a job I&#8217;m doing.  I&#8217;ve been holding onto the ability to elaborate and make changes, well past when I should, I suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had no complaints,&#8221; Luna said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a good person, Luna,&#8221; Miss told her.</p>
<p>Luna took the conversation as permission to take a seat on one of the benches.  Nobody glared at her for that, at least.</p>
<p>But of course, the moment she did that, the conversation died.</p>
<p>She watched the work, and she watched the assistants, and tried to make sense of what they were doing, and the processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming to the realization, not for the first time, that I may be a control freak,&#8221; Miss said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh?  You&#8217;re doing fine so far, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost too many.  Foundlings.  And people are the backbone of a place.  I can recycle some of them, but I can&#8217;t replace them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s feeling sorry for herself, when she did the best she could,&#8221; one assistant said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s injured, limping around with a hole in her chest that hasn&#8217;t healed,&#8221; another of the assistants added.  &#8220;We&#8217;re all very cross with her, up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Luna replied.  &#8220;I suppose I should join you in being cross, and in feeling sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; the assistant said.</p>
<p>Luna nodded, hands pressed into her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, I want control.  It&#8217;s very hard to do without, when you&#8217;ve taken responsibility for creating a pocket world, much less one that&#8217;s intrinsically tied to a small town with three thousand, six hundred residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a goddess, Miss?&#8221; Luna asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Not quite that.  Better to call me a higher power.  One with a limited realm.  But all I can do is fill in the gaps and work in the spaces that haven&#8217;t been defined yet.  Were I a proper goddess, I could change what I&#8217;ve already codified, and swell in power to distribute it elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re one of my first Foundlings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Number six, apparently.  I don&#8217;t know if that six counts the Ballerina in Blue, or&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t.  She&#8217;s her own kind of controlling.  Very insistent on staying to protect me, even though I know the Paths are pulling at her.  I should adapt, start preparing for life without her as my right hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Founder turned around.  The effect that kept her face and hands from being seen helped keep the papers in motion, guiding the wind currents.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t asking to be your right hand.  I just thought, uh, happy to help!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do need someone to run errands.  It&#8217;d require traveling to dangerous places.  We lost enough Foundlings in the last day.  There are still hostile agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, uh, yes.  I can manage.  I think.  I&#8217;ve never tried, but I can give it a shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of why you&#8217;re going is to negotiate good routes between the layers of Kennet.  Because there&#8217;s a lack, you&#8217;ll need to go, hm.  It&#8217;s up to you.  Matthew&#8217;s house is safest, I think he&#8217;s healing and recovering from the Demesne claim, though.  It&#8217;s a longer walk and there&#8217;s a chance he won&#8217;t be able to come to the door.  But if he does, you can enter and make your way up.  I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll begrudge you taking the safer route.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna hoped this errand wouldn&#8217;t involve disturbing too many sick and hurting people.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other alternative is a little riskier, but you&#8217;d go to answer Verona Hayward&#8217;s claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To go up to the&#8230; Kennet above?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Below first.  Then above.  Part of this is so you may introduce yourself, open dialogues, and even if you don&#8217;t take this job again, it&#8217;ll pave the way for others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is a good response, because it leads me to an ongoing anxiety as Founder.  <em>Are</em> you happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t make you to be happy by default, or overly helpful by default, but I would understand if you felt obligated, with me as your creator, to do as I ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She asks this a lot,&#8221; one of the assistants said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, it&#8217;s an ongoing anxiety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m mind controlled or pressured or obligated or anything,&#8221; Luna said.  &#8220;Can I get directions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Verona if she needs anything.  These are messages for the Vice Principal, Stew Mullen, and the Bitter Street Witch.  Toadswallow if he&#8217;s there.  While you&#8217;re there, see if you can find someone trusted to show you the way to Kennet above.  The routes between Kennet below and Kennet above are firmly established at this point.  Hidden paths and specific courses through neighborhoods will take you between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In defining this place, I made it a tranquil, resting place, with the idea that, well, I have to define it by what Kennet above and Kennet below aren&#8217;t, and what they aren&#8217;t, I find, is <em>calm</em>.  This is a healing place and a place in a kind of controlled stasis.  If anyone needs healing or needs a break, I hope they can come here.  Keep an ear out for any mentions of wounded or ailing.  Louise Bayer, council head of Kennet above, has her health issues.  Matthew Moss is recovering, as I said.  If you can ask without it being too awkward or forced, do ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we should exchange representatives.  It would do to have some flow of individuals between realms.  Knit them together better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna put her hands out.  Papers drifted by Miss as she went over her thoughts out loud, and they landed in Luna&#8217;s hands.  She sorted them by destination.</p>
<p>She took the last of them, then put them in her messenger bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  Thank you, Luna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221;  She dashed off, running down the railing by the stairs, sliding down the last section, and then got on with her errands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Verona Hayward&#8217;s Demesne was an especially crooked building on stilts, with a mural of images laid out into the hard-packed dirt between house and tree, light dirt packed down over darker dirt, to leave the shapes of human bodies, masks on.</p>
<p>The door banged open.  A boy stepped outside, then looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw <em>fuck no</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you, sir?&#8221; Luna called up.</p>
<p>The boy patted himself down, searching his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; Luna asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I bribe you?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to arrive here.  I don&#8217;t have a mask.  Can I bribe you to leave me alone until I can work something out, or buy a mask off you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No sir.  I&#8217;m on official government duty, actually, I&#8217;d like to keep to the rules.  Which means, um, one writ for being unmasked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She dumped me here on purpose, after I tried the Demesne challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a risk that&#8217;s not wholly impossible to anticipate,&#8221; she told him, while she wrote.  &#8220;You&#8217;re a repeat visitor.  I do believe that means you need to take a course.  Name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I don&#8217;t give you my name?&#8221;</p>
<p>She put an &#8216;x&#8217; on the form.  It auto-filled.  &#8220;Myles Sutton.  Alchemist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Healing potions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a nice talent.  Date of birth, I can fill you in, let&#8217;s see&#8230; For the maskless writ, you&#8217;ll need to get yourself to Sootsleeves&#8217; hold, that&#8217;s in the southwest corner of town, just look for the castle.  I suggest you get a mask before you arrive, or they&#8217;ll put you in a different line to get issued a mask, then put you in the back of the line for the writ.  Or so I hear.  Then once you&#8217;ve handled that, records office, that&#8217;s downtown, big building, Founder is there now, so look for that.  They can tell you about the civility course you&#8217;ll need to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A <em>course</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days condensed or seven spaced out, if I remember right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fucking serious?&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked up the stairs to where he was, and handed him the papers.  Then, easing around him, she went up the stairs to the door, knocking.  It swung open from the light taps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck, Myles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or seven.  Plus whatever time you spend getting sorted before and after.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed the door behind her.  She admired the art on the walls, and walked down the front hall to the living room.</p>
<p>Verona was there, wearing a striped sweater and a mask with faintly glowing lines where it had been divided and reconnected, running at diagonals.  The three sections looked like slightly different textures, tones, and material.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh man, scared me for a second there,&#8221; Verona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A certain city spirit once wore a rabbit mask when hanging out with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.  You&#8217;re not bigoted against rabbits, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the one so far.  You&#8217;re from Kennet found.  That&#8217;s a nice change from angry practitioners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luna.  Running errands for Miss.  She wants us Foundlings to get to know you guys and vice versa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great stuff.  In the interest of that&#8230; what do you do, Luna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Special powers, talents, abilities?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good at balancing, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.  That&#8217;s not too interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna shrugged.  Not all Foundlings or Lost had abilities, and not all abilities were good.  Luna just had the naturally good balance for walking on barrels, fences, walls, maybe a ceiling if she was <em>super</em> careful with how she balanced, and occasionally balancing on non-physical things.  &#8220;Got some papers for you.  Nothing big.  Information and a cheat sheet on rules to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  Is this volunteer work, voluntold work, paid work?  Something you do because of how she made you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paid.  Or at least, I&#8217;ll get memos, and those are as good as cash.  Better sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you buy?  This isn&#8217;t part of my Demesne challenge, just taking the chance to figure you guys out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clothes.  Food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to eat, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, uh, no.  Food gets supplied, just enough to keep us going, but we won&#8217;t hurt too much if we don&#8217;t have any.  Water&#8217;s free, milk is delivered in the mornings.  More than I need.  There&#8217;s a box with free eggs, gardens for vegetables.  My very busy neighbors get these papers, a lot like these memos, for making more food than they need and making it free.  But that&#8217;s- it changes up a lot.  They do a lot of projects.  There&#8217;s others like that, so there&#8217;s usually something every week, if you keep an ear out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna flicked the ear of her mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have to, but you don&#8217;t have to wear more than one outfit, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two at a minimum?  One to wear while you wash the other, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But like, different styles?  Would you wear something like that sweater and those jeans every day, or would you vary it up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d wear this every day.  Pretty much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Luna said.  &#8220;But uh, most people like change, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.  I guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Food is like that.  Vary it up.  But like, clothes change you in other people&#8217;s eyes, food helps you change in other ways.  Eat different to change your shape, make it easier to grow muscle, or get fat, or get thin.  Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yyyyes?  I feel like there&#8217;s a disconnect here, though.  You don&#8217;t die if you don&#8217;t eat, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, but have you ever died if you didn&#8217;t eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re not <em>that</em> different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  Fair argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t change how you eat you stay basically the same, and it&#8217;s the same for me.  I might like to grow up one day, but-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t have to?&#8221; Verona asked, sitting back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really.  But it&#8217;s nice to have the option, and that means I gotta eat right, I gotta have clothes I can wear as I grow, and I gotta meet the prerequisites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prerequisites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep track of birthdays, both mine and other people&#8217;s, get qualifications, or distinct <em>non</em>-qualifications, you know, if I want to grow up to do something low responsibility, low-income.  It&#8217;s all in the handbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to take a look sometime.  Makes growing up sound like getting a driver&#8217;s license.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?  If you ever want to find me, I&#8217;ll show you a copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh.  Gods and spirits, I might like Kennet found a little too much, if it works like you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m meant to ask if you need anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now?  Not especially.  I get the feeling the more antsy practitioners are poking around with sharp sticks to see what they can figure out or do to interfere with us.  And my claim to Kennet found is a big one.  But, upside, if I get any coup or any kind of partial victory, I can channel it into dumping them right back there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a couple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t causing too much commotion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  Longer term?  I&#8217;ll need to get a lower floor built, here.  I think that translates to a basement in Kennet above and Kennet below.  And the eventual, longer-term plan is to have it converted into a bookstore.  Maybe I can lift everything up and wedge it in beneath.  I need books for that.  Lucy said her mom got a free library.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s sources.  Books that were never written.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of them are pretty trash.  Turns out a lot of unfinished books were just unfinished because they&#8217;re ass,&#8221; Luna said.  &#8220;And I&#8217;m being polite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noted.  Okay, that&#8217;s super cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll need magical texts too, ideally, maybe in a back room, and regular texts, and nice notebooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do the nice notebooks.  Weird materials, weird paper, neat designs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit tricky.  I think you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s not expensive, it&#8217;s just&#8230; <em>time</em> expensive.  Finding the right people to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So in Kennet above, things cost too much and money&#8217;s hard to come by, but it&#8217;s pretty convenient.  In Kennet below, it&#8217;s cheap, sturdy, but usually pretty rough and you gotta be careful nobody innocent bled to make it.  And in Kennet found, it&#8217;s not too expensive, but arranging it&#8217;s a pain, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like people could do pretty well just handling arrangements, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like.  Miss wants people going back and forth.  Maybe a human could handle that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verona nodded.  &#8220;But I&#8217;m getting super distracted by cool stuff I haven&#8217;t had the chance to tackle yet.  You&#8217;ve got errands to run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve got this claim to wrap up.  So&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you put my exit at Kennet below?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can.  And in the meantime&#8230; you gotta answer the claim.  It&#8217;s your right to challenge me, and you have <em>some</em> claim.  But I think I get to decide the contest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t want to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just say &#8216;no contest&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No contest,&#8221; Luna told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.  Good luck with your errands.  Find a bodyguard as soon as you can, okay?  Kennet below is rough.  And there&#8217;s no restriction against violence, just the opposite, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to borrow some clothes?  The way you&#8217;re dressed&#8230; might be harder to get along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I&#8217;m dressed?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was wearing a white dress with a bit of lace on the sleeves and at the hem, the white rabbit mask, and tights with a lace pattern, broken up some by a light tan leather belt and the light tan messenger bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the hair.  They&#8217;ll see you as a target, and even if you claim you&#8217;re protected&#8230; some won&#8217;t care.  If you want to raid my clothes upstairs, get something, then bring it back later&#8230; oh, and don&#8217;t forget to take off the mask before going to Kennet above.  It&#8217;ll be seen as weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>What an uncomfortable idea.</p>
<p>Still, Luna decided to take the offer.  She went, got a lavender top with a moon on it and a weird fold at the bottom, old jeans that were a bit big for her- she needed her belt she&#8217;d worn with her dress, and the heels came within a few hairs of dragging on the ground, and then a slightly lumpy but very comfortable jacket.</p>
<p>She got herself sorted, got the A-ok, went to leave, turned back around, and went to shake Verona&#8217;s hand, which looked crumpled-up, so Luna shook the other one instead.  Then she turned around <em>again</em> and leaving by the door.</p>
<p>There were people just outside.  Some Others and a pair of humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The people of Kennet below had been described as rough, and this boy looked rough, hair shorn short, big jacket on.  &#8220;Hello.  You&#8217;re not the person who went inside ten minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  He went to Kennet found, after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t sure if the tone he was taking was because he was dangerous, or if he was from Kennet below, which very often had &#8216;dangerous&#8217; as a built in quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answered the claim, running some errands.  I&#8217;m in the market for bodyguards.  I have money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Something in the tone.  Luna kept her distance, pacing slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m probably the sort of person you need a bodyguard from, rabbit kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna bolted, and the guy didn&#8217;t chase, but his Others did.</p>
<p>She ended up being very glad she&#8217;d changed clothes, at least.  Not because it helped her fit in better, but the clothes were more durable than the lace dress and tights, and she needed that durability when the men in armor got clawed gauntlet-tips into her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spirits were normally representative of an endpoint.  Matter became other forms of matter, matter mixed, it blended, and it took on a state and quality, whether that was dirt or water or flesh or plastic.  Spirits happily took up residence, representing those qualities.  A spirit of flesh, a spirit of blood, a spirit of plastic, a spirit of pollution, a spirit of soil, a spirit of sand, a spirit of water, a spirit of waves.</p>
<p>Countless, innumerable, and to a practitioner, each could be a signpost of that quality and state, or of action, or meaning, symbol, or concept.  Where some stand, others stand by, ready to replace another spirit or put something into action.  Fire spirits waiting, quiet and hidden around a match.</p>
<p>And there are spirits that track broader patterns and labels.  The teacher, the cook, the terrible child, the madman.  And sometimes those broader patterns and labels can make impressions deep enough that the <em>animus</em> will form, and that leads to the Great Teacher, who <em>contrives</em> to exist despite having no prior existence, arrives on a scene, imparts a great lesson onto those who need a teacher, and then moves on to other locations and venues, sustaining herself as a <em>role</em>.</p>
<p>Up until a location was disturbed.  That which was flat and ordered becomes uneven, with droughts and floods of meaning and concept.  Spiritual flows concentrate, interrupt, feed back on one another, and disrupt.</p>
<p>And that which was hidden becomes obvious, and the obvious is buried, and much of this is subtle, except for places where it is not.  The same spaces that could form an animus if given enough depth are all there, as shallow impressions and greater ones, or even ones that aren&#8217;t actually meant to be, that are jarred into existence by the great shuffling and confusion, or pressed in by the flows of certain spirits into certain impressions, digging those impressions deep.</p>
<p>And as a town forms a dark half, the impressions are filled, the universe contrives, power flows and people form, with vague memories of histories that become sharper as they are defined and clarified, with roles as simple as &#8216;the third smartest child in class&#8217; or &#8216;the boy who is good at sports&#8217;, until a rough balance has been reached.</p>
<p>A dark underside to the town forms.</p>
<p>Once that rough balance has formed, the flooding of spirit and other powers form an equilibrium, though it is imperfect, and spirit and other energies steadily flow out, from the town above to the town below.  The town above steadily loses people, the town below gains some, but only to a degree.  It is uneven, and when the town above dies, the town below will die too.</p>
<p>Among the uneven impressions and varied roles across the town, many of which are now filled, the flows continue to push things out of balance.  A space for a man who is meant to be big and tough creates a man that is drawn out to many times the size he should be, made far tougher.  The space reserved for the child riding on an adult&#8217;s back is formed not as a shallow puddle that will dry up in a moment, but as a pond, lasting and stagnant, growing larger, creating tributaries.</p>
<p>A young lady fills the space of the &#8216;kook&#8217;, that odd individual who convinces herself she has special abilities, and falls into various spiritualities and mystical beliefs.  Except in her case, with the flows as they are, the beliefs are brutal and bloody, and they work in a vivid way.  She can see the future, given the right conditions.</p>
<p>She can see the future sketched out before her.  It&#8217;s enough for her to know that the other changes, the ruts carved out that make her bent and broken, they&#8217;ll continue.  Within a month she already moves like a broken old woman three times her age.  Given a few years, she&#8217;ll be unable to move at all, curled around the stick she used to use to walk, able to see and barely able to even speak, with a jaw bent in three places.</p>
<p>It makes her bitter, angry at the world, and driven.  She <em>must</em> find solutions, and she must find them with a fragile body that can break and heal with odd bends in it if it is so much as looked at the wrong way, in an impulsive and violent town where people are happy to break everything and anything they can.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing <em>I</em> find,&#8221; Nicolette mused, &#8220;is that the Universe really does want to share its secrets.  It&#8217;s like a person with a juicy story to tell.  They only need a little prodding to share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to get better at sharing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did my program come through okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch pressed buttons, narrowing her eyes at the screen.  The numbers on the screen took a moment to organize themselves, unfocusing and refocusing as if she was looking through with very tired eyes.  One bold line.  The latest of thirty-nine emails from Nicolette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did.  Or she tried.  The laptop spat a mysterious link at her, instead, and it throbbed on the screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fucking-&#8221;  She tore the power cord out.  &#8220;If you want power, wretched machine, you&#8217;ll stop trying to fling that nonsense at me.  I&#8217;ll <em>starve</em> you.  Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure I can&#8217;t get you a better laptop?&#8221; Nicolette asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the Witch snarled.  She ripped the grate off the side of the laptop, then dug the blade of a broken fingernail inside until she found flesh, and she scraped and jabbed at the flesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would see it as an investment in you.  Something workable, durable, easy to use&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The link disappeared, the screen returning to normal.  &#8220;Open the email.&#8221;</p>
<p>The email opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the program whatever,&#8221; she said, leaning back, hands away from the keyboard.  The blood on her fingernail tasted sour.</p>
<p>The program opened.  It gave her a rough panel with lots of names and requests.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;d be less capricious than whatever you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this machine because it works better when I hit it and remind it who the boss is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, offer stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you open the video call?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shifted a knee, jarring the battered old computer.  &#8220;Machine.  You heard her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video call booted up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a computer that recognizes voice commands.  And it doesn&#8217;t look like you have a microphone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The three girls gave me this.  They used it for their big diagram, they passed it on to me.  Don&#8217;t need a microphone if there&#8217;s something in there that gets jolted alive when electricity runs through it, and if that something has ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could see Nicolette, and she could see some trim young men in suits behind her.  And one less trim man in a suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221; Nicolette asked.  &#8220;Oh, them?  Who are you asking about?  Please don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s Chase.&#8221;</p>
<p>The less trim one looked up, frowning.  He had a broad forehead and a broad chin that made his face look disproportionately small.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blondie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tanner.  That&#8217;s Chase, Tanner, Wye,&#8221; Nicolette said, moving her finger to indicate each in turn.  &#8220;Chase was technically my mentor, as I&#8217;m yours, now.  We&#8217;ve gone our separate ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a ploy.  Putting two pretty boys in front of me to try to draw me out.  You want me to come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, I still get spooked when you say things like &#8216;this is a ploy&#8217;,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;I keep thinking I have to be on guard, that you&#8217;re a newly Awakened, and you&#8217;ll accidentally lie if we aren&#8217;t careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels like a ploy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better.  It isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which two of us are pretty?&#8221; Chase asked, looking over.  He was in the background, so his voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do some augury to figure that one out?&#8221; Tanner asked.  Nice voice.</p>
<p>Nicolette ignored them.  &#8220;Hey, BSW, I&#8217;d love for you to come to me, but honestly, I find these guys so utterly against what I find attractive in a man that the idea of using them as eye candy didn&#8217;t occur to me,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;Really truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you two need some privacy for your girl talk, there&#8217;s a hundred and six other rooms in or immediately proximate to this building that you could go to,&#8221; Tanner said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not girl talk.  It&#8217;s anti-asshole talk.  There&#8217;s a distinction,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;Wye?  I&#8217;m sorting the list.  Tags for faction.  If you&#8217;re on a job, I&#8217;ll let you have Belanger blue.  I&#8217;ll take purple.  And we&#8217;ll red-tag anything that&#8217;s safe for my apprentice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  I&#8217;m giving you pretty open access, Nico, so do me a favor, don&#8217;t go sneaking any jobs that are five figures or more under the table to yourself, or her?  Not without asking first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five figures.  The Witch renewed her interest, hunching over the computer.  Blood was oozing and sparking around one of the keys.  She used a tissue to wipe away at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Tanner too young for you?&#8221; Nicolette asked, quiet.  Talking while she worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old do you think I am?&#8221; the Witch asked.  &#8220;And you don&#8217;t have to whisper.  It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty&#8230; nine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m closer to your age than that.  It&#8217;s fine.  He wouldn&#8217;t have me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d be surprised what someone like Tanner would have.  And you deserve better, anyway.  Look.  I had you handle the card thing, did you finish?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch picked up the cards.  She&#8217;d taken playing cards and painted over each card in white, and then scrawled on images that fit what she&#8217;d been told to write.  One deck that was like the decks they used, with a set of keywords, one deck of tarot.  The images were very scratchy, and colored in with blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reason I wanted you on the video call is so I can see what you&#8217;re doing.  While I work, you should work with the cards.  See what you pick up.  If your natural talents are as strong as they seem to be, you should get something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch sighed.  She watched as Wye came through, bringing cookies and tea to Nicolette.  It was completely absent, unthinking, automatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Nicolette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure.  Welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>It reminded her that she hadn&#8217;t eaten or had much to drink, and because she was eating less bird heads than she once had, it was a lot easier to feel hungry.  She rang her bell, then lurched to her feet, scooping up the laptop with one arm that had broken in five places and healed at odd angles every time, with fingers much the same, and gripped her walking stick with the other.  Even with two legs and the stick, getting to the counter was a task.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; her brother asked.  Donny was a potato head, if the potato had been left to get a bit soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food.  You were cooking earlier, right?  And hot water.  I&#8217;ll make my own tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grunted, then left.</p>
<p>She sat on the stool with the raised back that helped keep her from falling out, and then jammed her stick through the hole in the side of the counter where Giblet had put his foot through.  A bit of hot oil had dripped onto his foot and he&#8217;d fallen from his stool on the far side of the counter, kicking anything and everything he could, thinking it was a snake or something.  Ruining her things.</p>
<p>Funny, but it was a few minutes of laughing, weeks of a hole in her cabinet.</p>
<p>Donny came back, bringing the bowl, and put it on the counter.  She peered at it, dubious.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boiled meat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you not to.  That was expensive meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faster, same thing in the end, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boiled meat, and pasta that had been overcooked until it was almost incorporated into the water.  And then hot water&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the water from the same pot?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;Meat and pasta?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I strained out the bits.  Mostly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boil regular water, Donny.  Don&#8217;t get it from somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullen, he walked away.</p>
<p>But he stopped at the doorway.  &#8220;You gotta warlord some, you know.  People say stuff.  You aren&#8217;t showing your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shit.  If even <em>Donny</em> was saying so?</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They know you&#8217;re all bent and stuff, so they talk about it a lot.  If you might get so sick you can&#8217;t do anything anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll handle it.  Good boy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Older than you,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t good boy me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Donny?  Do you remember what I asked you to do, before you left the room?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned around, mouth agape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boil clean water for my tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.  I remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy,&#8221; she said, pointed.</p>
<p>Nicolette, on the far side of the screen, was eating one of the cookies, her attention captivated by whatever it was she was typing.</p>
<p><em>Warlord things. </em> The Bitter Street Witch pulled the cards from a pocket, then laid them out.  When she was done, she picked up the bowl, wrapping her hand around it to ensure a better grip, even though it was hot enough to make her skin prickle and redden.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a cookie.  Proper tea.  And even if the boys wouldn&#8217;t ever want someone as broken as her, it would be nice to at least have them to look at, instead of Donny.</p>
<p>But there was a freedom here.  Here, she could be what she was.  If she kept to her base nature, it was accepted.  There, what would she be?</p>
<p>&#8220;Tilt the screen forward?&#8221; Nicolette asked.</p>
<p>She showed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying you did it wrong, but I&#8217;m curious about the arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so the two layouts can talk to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  Okay.  Screenshotting that&#8230; Oh I forgot you have a technomancy computer, that <em>disturbed</em> the screenshot.  Hm.  I&#8217;ll take notes with pen and paper.  Don&#8217;t move anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch sighed and drank from the bowl.  The meat, cut into uneven strips, was boiled tough enough she&#8217;d probably chew through her tongue with the accidental bites here and there, before she got through the meat.  She tilted her head back and choked it down whole.  Let her body absorb whatever it wanted from that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that sound your technomancy laptop or you?&#8221; Nicolette asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Let&#8217;s see&#8230; What&#8217;s your initial read?  How do you approach this?  First instinct?  Don&#8217;t move any cards just yet, I&#8217;m still trying to take everything down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I look for the things I recognize.  There.  Rat lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rat on right side, reversed lovers on right.  Alright.  What does that mean to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually it&#8217;s the opossum and deer.  But I&#8217;ve seen it be others.  Sometimes Musser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Familiars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  So what&#8217;s your next instinct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I move the cards?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhhh&#8230; Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put a hand down on the cards, then moved those cards and the ones around them to the center.  Then she set out other cards around them.  The decks mixed a bit in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk me through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting clarification.  What surrounds those things?  Why is it important enough it boils up to the top?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Sure.  And we have&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lantern.  Tower.  Blood.  You said I should add that one.  It comes up a lot,&#8221; the Witch noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was coming up here, related to Kennet, so I suggested it, yeah.  Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the turned knife,&#8221; the Witch said, placing a crooked finger onto the card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually means betrayal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  And the eight of swords,&#8221; she said, nudging a card.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cage, entrapment, enslavement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All together?  A forced familiar ritual.  A betrayal.  Turned moon, though.  Falsehood, somehow.  An offer of a familiar relationship, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside the room, another girl had made an appearance.  If the Bitter Street Witch was only a few years older than Tanner, the girl was only that many years younger.  Blue eyed, blonde, and <em>straight</em> in shape.  Narrow hips, narrow shoulders, slender, upright, small chested, straight hair, even.  Narrow little blue tie that drew a straight line from collar to where her belly button would be, and a pencil skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Gillian,&#8221; Nicolette said, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to be quiet?&#8221; Gillian asked Tanner, barely audible, pointing at the screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  That&#8217;s just Nico&#8217;s apprentice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh really?  Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch didn&#8217;t want that girl looking at the screen and seeing her.  Not that girl.  Not- not in any way.  She wanted it even less than she wanted someone like Tanner looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to my office,&#8221; Nicolette said, as she picked up the laptop, and Tanner, Wye, Chase, and Gillian were swept off the screen as she moved around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something sensitive you need to talk about?  That&#8217;s fine.  Just let me know when you have the ticket interface done.  We&#8217;re getting swamped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, apprentice?  Keep the cards out,&#8221; Nicolette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm,&#8221; the Bitter Street Witch grunted.</p>
<p>If she were there, in that world, would she feel like she&#8217;d felt in the moment before Nicolette had carried the laptop away?  Suffocating?  Like something <em>lesser</em>, when she was a thriving warlord?  Lesser than a fifteen year old girl in a stupid tie who had probably never seen a person die, let alone <em>cause</em> that death?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they related?&#8221; the Witch asked.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t keep secrets from me.  Be upfront.  That&#8217;s the only way this works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tanner and Gillian?&#8221; Nicolette asked.</p>
<p>Right on the money, and with her hands full, it wasn&#8217;t like Nicolette had read any cards or viewed any devices.</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch had never seen the point in being overly subtle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Tanner was brought in by Alexander.  Aware, then awakened.  Unrelated to the family.  Gillian is a Belanger by blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to decide if I should give you all the facts, or go easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you go easy on me?  If I&#8217;m weak enough I can&#8217;t take hearing some words, what use am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Wye is probably going to raise the idea of marrying her to Tanner.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch shifted position.  No matter how she sat, normally, it felt like a bone was digging into the seat beneath her.  It had never felt quite as pronounced as it did now.  &#8220;She&#8217;s young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be right away.  After she graduates university, if I&#8217;m reading him right,&#8221; Nicolette said, settling into her office.  The Witch could see the room behind her, and the various headpieces on the wall, each set to branch, feather, or arch back from above and behind the ear toward the back of the head.  They were arranged into circles on the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;After university.  Twenty, twenty one,&#8221; the Witch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tanner in his mid to late twenties.  It&#8217;s a shift in stance and approaches.  Not expanding the family, but consolidating it.  Which is frankly needed.  Gillian is head over heels for Tanner.  I- you don&#8217;t repeat what I say next, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught her standing outside his room late at night.  Trying to work up the courage to knock.  When she saw me, she was embarrassed, ran.  I&#8217;ve kept an eye out to make sure she won&#8217;t try again, but I think she&#8217;s too afraid to.  It&#8217;s for the best.  Tanner has his gross moments, but he&#8217;d say no, and she&#8217;d be embarrassed.  But given an education, a chance to grow up, remove her young age from the equation&#8230; I think he&#8217;d say yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To her advance or to marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both.  She&#8217;d be happy.  He&#8217;d be alright.  I&#8217;d want to be around, make sure she stands up for herself.  Against her mother, against Tanner.  But they&#8217;d both get what they want and need.  The family gets what it needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you need, B?&#8221; Nicolette asked, voice soft.  &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch sat with her feelings for a moment.  She moved her fingers and they cracked and popped, sometimes in places where there were no knuckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you want to know what I need and want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say?  Be upfront?  That&#8217;s the best way for this to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch heaved in a breath, and her ribs popped in similar ways to her knuckles.  &#8220;You&#8217;ll think less of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know, I have memories of starving?  Of being small, sickly, and neglected, ravenous with hunger?&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one, she picked up the cards Nicolette had told her to keep put.  Nicolette didn&#8217;t interrupt to stop her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can imagine,&#8221; Nicolette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have memories of being ravenous with hunger, until I ate trash out of bins, and it didn&#8217;t matter that it was food or not.  It just mattered that it was soft enough to choke down.  Animal hunger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And right now-&#8221; She cracked her hand again.  Anxious, restless, wanting to act, to get up, abandon the laptop.  She wanted to go do things by instinct.  &#8220;-I feel that same hunger.  But not for food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a spell.  I want a practice, vicious, mean, raw, dead things as part of the circle, that lets me snatch her body from her.  Push her out of it, take it for myself, my talent, her <em>shape.  </em>I want to be born to what she was born to, to eat that food without- without being the lowest thing in that room.  I want to be her, someone who can stand at someone&#8217;s door to offer myself to them, and have it be- be <em>charming</em>, naive, mutually embarrassing, but not&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She extended a limb, until the sleeve rolled down her arm to the elbow.  She could see bone pressing against skin.  Crooked arm, crooked fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Not a moment from a horror film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicolette was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to take what she has and give her what I have, and make her live it, make her realize what she&#8217;s taken for granted, and then- then stomp on her.  Break these limbs while she has them.  Break her pelvis again.  Break her jaw.  <em>Pulp</em> her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicolette leaned back in her seat, exhaling.</p>
<p>The Witch let her sit with that for a moment.  <em>Then I&#8217;d go to university.  I&#8217;d marry someone beautiful.  I&#8217;d have a family with more than ten brain cells between them.</em></p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t say that, though.  She preferred to leave Nicolette with thoughts of bloody pulp, not dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even really know her.  What she lives with.  Who her mom is,&#8221; Nicolette said, not looking at the screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicolette nodded to herself.  &#8220;You can&#8217;t, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <em>could.</em>&#8221; The Witch shifted position on the stool, putting her face close to the little camera.  &#8220;I can eat the head off a bird and see the future.  I could find a way in.  If I can&#8217;t figure it out myself, I&#8217;ll eat the heads of birds and read cards until I can find what I need to do as a first step.  I&#8217;ll make nice with the Oldbodies, for their tricks and insights, and I&#8217;ll scrape, scavenge, fight, and work myself raw, until I find out how.  Do you think I can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it without severe consequence.  You&#8217;d probably get caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch looked aside.  &#8220;Do you think less of me, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; Nicolette said.  She swiveled her seat, then put her feet up on the edge of the desk, hands across her middle.  She looked at the camera.  &#8220;No.  I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my story.  I have, for most intents and purposes, a hole in my head.  A big weak point.  I&#8217;ve lost my mind before.  I&#8217;ve been broken, defeated.  I&#8217;ve been hungry enough I was more animal than human, embarrassing myself and making a mess in my hurry to accept food I was given.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s not exactly the same.  But I also know that ravenous feeling you have, that isn&#8217;t hunger.  Of feeling like you&#8217;re on the bottom, or being on the bottom, and seeing someone who-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has everything I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Been there too, B,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be the lowest of the low here.  I mean, even putting Seth aside, with his situation, the fact he betrayed us in a pinch, these guys are some real dickholes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in morals, or character.  I could be a saint compared to them, it wouldn&#8217;t make the kind of difference I want.  And I&#8217;m no saint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  What do you say we abbreviate your mission statement there?  You want a fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  You sure did abbreviate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicolette ventured, &#8220;It&#8217;d be easier if you were here.  Would involve keeping you away from Gillian-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep her away from me, you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  But if you were here- I know that-&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch was sighing again, interrupting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re not keen.  But when I arrived, I was a mess.  And that&#8217;s a lot to get past, especially when they&#8217;re judgmental assholes and you can see that old self reflected in their eyes.  I <em>know</em>, believe me.  But it puts you closer to resources, and it&#8217;ll make working together easier, growing, getting cash and cachet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d need to find a replacement.  I haven&#8217;t done that yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  I&#8217;m just saying, if you want better, you need to take the steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;You picked up the cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would&#8217;ve liked to refine that more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need to.  This is where you and I are different.  I know enough to know what to look out for.  So the time you&#8217;d spend refining?  That&#8217;s time I can spend learning what else to watch out for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  Well, let&#8217;s see what that looks like.  A false familiar ritual betrayal, and&#8230;?  I&#8217;ll be coding while you work, by the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch laid out more cards onto the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burning books,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cards had come down in a rough two-to-one proportion.  The &#8216;two&#8217; was destructive cards, fire, swords, spades, fang&#8230; and the one was passive ones.  Book, wands.</p>
<p>Except there was one card in each location that was meant for the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me copy that down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a minute.  Use shorthand.  Because this is something I act on soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?  I&#8217;m reading that as a very brutal, lost fight on the part of the more calculating members of the invading force.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch nodded, straightening some cards here and there.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s probably a lot to be read into that,&#8221; Nicolette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably.  I don&#8217;t care.  I&#8217;ve picked up enough.  I&#8217;m doing another reading.  Then I need to go.  You can finish your program, I have to be a local warlord.  I&#8217;ll be back later, and you can give me jobs to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhh&#8230; thirty more seconds?  If I can identify who those cards are, it&#8217;ll help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch gave her those thirty seconds.</p>
<p>As she picked up the cards, dividing them between the two decks, Nicolette said, &#8220;Your instincts are strong.  It&#8217;s very raw.  There&#8217;s a lot of practices you could do to refine the end results, clarify the picture, but there&#8217;s something to be said for getting raw, meaningful results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you still, if you want to awaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch laid out the other cards.  Child, blood and moon.  The knife, turned the other way, stabbing forward, not back.  Then fire, broken fist.  She drew a card, holding it face-down, and moved it over the arranged cards, seeing if it wanted to go anywhere.  She laid it down over the broken fist.  Treasure.</p>
<p>She peeked under some cards she&#8217;d placed face down.  A door.  A turned moon, from the tarot deck.  The hermit.  Those were possible outcomes.  She could follow the lines and placements of the cards&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to study your approach.  A lot of practices have gained something by studying the Aware and the Others and how they engage with the same ideas,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m taking these notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch moved the most important cards into a circle, then placed another in the center.  <em>Where?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; Nicolette said.  &#8220;You didn&#8217;t let me copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>She got up from her seat, nearly falling.</p>
<p>&#8220;B?&#8221; Nicolette asked.</p>
<p>The Bitter Street Witch hated the nickname but was willing to admit that &#8216;Bitter Street Witch&#8217; was a mouthful and &#8216;Witch&#8217; was far too nonspecific when practitioner talked to practitioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do your read of that.  While you do that, sitting in your safe little school hours away from the problems you&#8217;re solving, I&#8217;m going to go act on it.  I&#8217;ll be checking your answers later, keep you on your toes, right?  If you&#8217;re going to be my mentor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a deal,&#8221; Nicolette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No time for deals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that, but on your end of things&#8230; don&#8217;t eat another bird head.  You&#8217;ll pick up other types of practice if you don&#8217;t fall back on crutches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My life is crutches, mentor,&#8221; the Witch replied.  &#8220;And it&#8217;s a child&#8217;s life at stake.  So tell me, do you want me to eat the bird&#8217;s head or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, she banged on the door, pushing it open.  Her brother Donny was sitting by the fire, staring off into space.</p>
<p>He startled, looking at the kettle he&#8217;d forgotten to set on to boil.</p>
<p>There was a reason she kept him close to home.  He was just not the best one to send on any errand that was more than a word in length.</p>
<p>&#8220;With me,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>He went to her side, supporting her as she walked.  She could lean into him, using her stick to help distribute weight, picking it up to point it when she needed to indicate a direction.</p>
<p>Matthew Moss, Louise, and Toadswallow were by some market stalls that were being set up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look perturbed, dear Witch,&#8221; Toadswallow said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not get the message we were setting up for the market?&#8221; Louise asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.  You&#8217;re fine.  I&#8217;ll put extra security on things later, so your intruders can visit the market and see what it has to offer.  If they turn around and try to rob it, we&#8217;ll make it hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Louise said.  &#8220;This feels like a disaster waiting to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could see how Moss was sitting next to Louise.  They&#8217;d become friends.</p>
<p>She kind of resented that.  &#8220;Moss, with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?  Hm?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;With me.  There are things that need our mutual attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew&#8217;s tired,&#8221; Louise said.  &#8220;He just had what I&#8217;ve heard described as a marathon Demesne claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care.  With me.  Toadswallow, you stay, focus on the market.  And when I get back, you need to tell me if you&#8217;re going to be one of our council members, representing Kennet below, or if you&#8217;ll stay above, and just have your market here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An ultimatum?&#8221; Toadswallow asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m impatient, and I need to figure things out, and there are things I can&#8217;t work out until you get off your saggy behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow smiled.  &#8220;Alright.  You&#8217;re sure I can&#8217;t go instead of Matthew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Oh, and one more thing?  The two factions of the invaders are approaching a breaking point.  Your goblins know the opossum, and the opossum knows the second witch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a message to the witches then.  They should talk to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toadswallow whistled.  But she was already hobbling away, motioning to Moss.</p>
<p>He grunted as he got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donny, go get your brothers.  Have one of them drive.  And if they fight over who gets to drive, tell them I said I&#8217;ll break this walking stick off in their asses.  Come over by the Arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donny stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went.  She had to catch herself with the walking stick as he let go of her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moss?  Prop me up or I&#8217;ll fall and break something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He replaced Donny as her support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might need someone to prop <em>me</em> up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But he did what he was supposed to.  They managed a decent enough speed.</p>
<p>He smelled good.  Like cedar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Moss,&#8221; she said, when they were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm hmm.  These are congratulations you owe me for.  And this is a debt owed that you should pay back promptly.  I&#8217;ll be cashing in the goodwill I&#8217;ve been picking up shortly, just in case I find a good replacement and need to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.  Except, what are the congratulations for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Moss, are going to have an offer of a familiar, except not really.  Or you&#8217;ll be offered a false familiar.  And you will accept, or you&#8217;ll be made to accept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know who.&#8221;</p>
<p>His expression visibly darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t force it.  That&#8217;s not how that works.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged, as much as she could with her arm firmly in his grip.  &#8220;They&#8217;ll fake force it then.  And then you&#8217;ll accept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there degrees of prophecy?  Ranging from like, vague notions to something capital-T True?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No idea.  I&#8217;m not that kind of Augur, with me, you get what you get.  There&#8217;s no negotiating, no nuance.  You know what&#8217;s coming, so prepare accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>His expression darkened more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The appropriate response is &#8216;thank you&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Moss said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You owe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.  I&#8217;ll figure it out.  Is that why you wanted me to come with?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>No</em>.  &#8220;Yes.  In part.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.  &#8220;What&#8217;s the other part?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll find out.  I just know it&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woods by the Arena, not that far from Hayward&#8217;s Demesne claim.</p>
<p>She heard voices.  Her ears, at least, hadn&#8217;t gone crooked.</p>
<p>They ventured through the trees until they could see the figures.</p>
<p>A girl with a rabbit mask was standing in a chalk circle.  Two figures in armor with blurry features beneath their helmets were standing on either side of her, weapons out.  It was probably completely unnecessary, but they kept her in position, one blade held behind her neck, the other in front, in a way that forced her to keep her chin stretched upward.</p>
<p>A group of other practitioners stood by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to make me ask three times for every answer you give?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe try asking that two more times to see?&#8221; the girl replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squeezing her for information,&#8221; Moss murmured.</p>
<p>The Witch nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you want to handle this?  You seemed to have an idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, are there any ways to circumvent the writs or get emergency access out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, I ask a second time, and on a third, by the Seal, you must answer.  You don&#8217;t have the status, freedom, or clout to say no.  Are there any ways to circumvent the writs or get emergency access out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard the squeal of tires.  By the looks of it, at least two of the people by the boy doing the interrogation had heard too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make noise.  Big practice.  Let that darkness out, if you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty wobbly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t do anything, they&#8217;ll get what they want out of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch stared at the girl, studying her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew stepped forward, and he let the darkness out. It was smaller.  Barely bigger than he was, and ghostly, with images of Edith James&#8217; face emerging from the midst of it, crashing out past one another, in a succession.  It crashed into the side of the damaged, broken down building, and the impact was enough to produce a faint rumble as parts of the roof, already mostly caved in, fell.</p>
<p>Ramming into three of the other practitioners at the edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rescue party?&#8221; the boy with the short hair asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distraction,&#8221; the Witch said, her back to a tree, quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distraction,&#8221; Moss said, louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see your friend there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy adjusted something on the gauntlet he wore, and then pointed.  Moss&#8217;s darkness moved, and it caught the brunt of a series of skewers.  They slowed as they hit the darkness, then hit the tree with enough impact that they penetrated.  The Witch pulled her head away just in time, as two metal skewers hit the foot-and-a-half-thick tree and punched through, with one or two inches of protrusion.</p>
<p>And the darkness was smaller than Matthew.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re distracting me from something else.  Which is-&#8221;</p>
<p>Her brothers.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d heard the sound and swerved around the parking lot, looking for what it might be.  They were dumb.  They were <em>extraordinarily</em>, bend-reality kinds of dumb.  They were several stripes of dumb in each of them, from the shortsighted to the reckless to the dimwitted to the scattered.  And that was fine.  She did love them.</p>
<p>But they were trustworthy for one thing, and that one thing was getting into stupid fights.  So even if they missed the target sometimes, they could land places that would soon see them taking out her enemies, which was <em>just</em> what she wanted them to do.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d found <em>this</em> fight.  And they&#8217;d brought lackeys.  Rather than fight over who got to drive, they&#8217;d had each of them drive, maybe racing each other.  Cars packed with violent idiots.</p>
<p>She stepped out of the trees, stick in hand, and pointed it, directing them.  &#8220;Oh, Moss?  Keep me alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easier-&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved the shadow into the way of the backhanded attack magic the boy with the gauntlet sent at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;-said than done.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all she needed.  Her brothers went after the ones she&#8217;d pointed at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call them off!  Do you want me to kill the hostage?&#8221; the boy shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t.  They&#8217;re idiots, they don&#8217;t really listen.  I can send them to get into fights, but I&#8217;m not so dumb I&#8217;ll try to pull them away from one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Figure it out!&#8221;</p>
<p>The practitioner lackeys had practice, the brothers had numbers and <em>awful</em> self preservation.</p>
<p>Matthew used the shadow to confront the knights, who&#8217;d moved their weapons away from the throat and neck of the bunny girl, and then pulled spell cards out of his pocket.  Just like the ones Verona, Lucy, and Avery used.</p>
<p>There were ways this could go, where she ended up utterly alone, no brothers.  It was in the cards.</p>
<p>If it came to that, she&#8217;d leave.</p>
<p>And there was an end result where she let him go to a door, and the closest thing she could think of to a door was Hayward&#8217;s ritual.  Beat his ass, chuck him through, let her deal with him, then catch him on the other side.  Whatever that involved.</p>
<p>Leaving another possibility.  The utilized secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you know anything about this guy?&#8221; she asked Moss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.  Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Figured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meaning he was either going to murder her brothers, or&#8230;</p>
<p>He ran, while there was still a gap, attacking people on his way through.  He had his soldiers help secure his retreat, moving back from the fight and forming a loose, two-individual barricade.</p>
<p>He was the one with the secret.</p>
<p>The others ran too, and she let her brothers keep chasing, because it was useless to call them off.  Matthew, meanwhile, hurried over to the girl, foot scuffing the chalk circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Matthew Moss, I presume?&#8221; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have paperwork for you.  Notices, information.  If you&#8217;re drained and tired, you&#8217;re to go downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s focus on getting you okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And miss Bitter Street Witch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For you as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very focused on the job,&#8221; Moss said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather-&#8221; the girl paused.  The paper she was holding out trembled.  &#8220;I&#8217;d like to please focus on it for now.  Being a representative, running errands for Miss.  Earning a bit of pay.  Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Witch hobbled forward, and took the paper.  Matthew supported her before she could sway where she stood.  Information packets.  Notes on exchanging members between areas.  Above, below, found.</p>
<p>She folded it and put it into a pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I give you an errand?&#8221; the Bitter Street Witch asked.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s neck, red where the blade had brushed skin but not broken it, moved as she swallowed hard.  &#8220;Of course.  After I&#8217;ve run any more important errands, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an easy one.&#8221;</p>

<p>They would have screamed if they had mouths, but they had none.  Distilled, bifurcated personhood, they lunged forward madly, unthinking, on pure instinct.  And because they had no mouths, they could not eat.  And because they could not eat, they had limited reserves.  They had but one try, survival of the fittest.  One goal, held in brainless minds.</p>
<p>The corridor was flesh, glistening and lightless, but the motes of personhood had no eyes, so it did not matter.  No noses.  Mad and frantic, they tore past one another, lost their way, there were malformed ones among them, barely able to move.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;d had eyes and if their goal had meaning, their goal might have glowed like a sun.  But it didn&#8217;t.  They were dark, the corridor was dark, and the destination was dark, and in a mad chase along damp flesh, they fumbled, if such brainless motes could be said to &#8216;fumble&#8217;, exactly.</p>
<p>And one mote, by chance, by being more frantic, was victorious.  It reached the destination, a barrier that resisted, absorbed.  And bifurcated personhood became personhood, entire engines of growth, life, nature, time, death, and dying off kicking into motion.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>It was all very weird to Dom.  It felt like everything conflicted.</p>
<p>He loved his sister, but it was also a pain in the ass that she was back and okay and so very worried about him being here.</p>
<p>Musser apparently had taken a shine to him, with nice words to say, and that was apparently enough for the entire family to do better, he guessed?  His dad and mom were happy and talking more about possibilities.  But then at the same time, Musser had left and they hadn&#8217;t been any of the important picks.</p>
<p>And it was cool, after school had been so empty, to be around so many other practitioners, and even some older kids who didn&#8217;t act like they hated having him around.  Maybe that was because Musser had liked him, but&#8230;</p>
<p>It was cool.</p>
<p>He still wished he could be at school, though.  With Talia, Jorja, and Effy.  That had been the best time while it had lasted.  Learning what he could in big classes with older kids, good food, then going off to swim with his friends, or play in the field.</p>
<p>This kind of open space with fresh air felt a lot like that.  The cabin had felt confined, and the bathroom had been full, so he&#8217;d come out to pee in the bushes and then kinda just stayed outside.  He dragged a stick through the dirt, drawing out vague diagram ideas, ready to stomp on them if they did anything.</p>
<p>Bushes rustled.</p>
<p>He drew out his wand and held out the stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; the girl said.  She stepped out of the woods.  She had a rabbit mask on, and some rumpled clothes.  She kept her hands in her pockets.  &#8220;If you use the big stick, is that like having a super fat wand for big fat spells?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would be cool,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not a threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; he said.  He looked around.  &#8220;Is there a threat I don&#8217;t know about?  A friend of yours that <em>is</em> a threat?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.  &#8220;Not to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She approached, and he remained where he was, stick and wand held out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, supposed to remove this,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She pulled off the mask.</p>
<p>Her eyes were very dark, but her face was otherwise normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel naked without the mask on,&#8221; she said, putting a hand over her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess.  Foundling.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.  There had been a big talk about the new town and classifying Others, earlier today.</p>
<p>He thought for a second.  &#8220;What do you want?  Why is it me you&#8217;re coming to talk to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re not one of the violent ones, and what I really wanted to do is find someone who can pass on a message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.  What message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just supposed to find you, bring you further away so someone else can talk to you, lay it all out.  The person giving the message is one of the local practitioners.  They&#8217;re keeping an eye out for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like a trap, kind of.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.  &#8220;But I know it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He studied her.  Maybe she thought it wasn&#8217;t, but she was being tricked so someone else could spring the trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who am I talking to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery Kelly.  With the deer mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  She was really good at sports.  It was cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she?  Neat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kept studying her, looking for a hint.</p>
<p>The way she stood reminded him a lot of Talia.  Very straight.  Trying very hard.</p>
<p>The aura around her, it felt different, though.  Like she knew exactly who she was and was strong in that.  Like Jorja, kind of.  Talia didn&#8217;t have that.</p>
<p>He admired his friends in different ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could get Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth, I&#8217;m quoting someone, has been a huge pain in the butt,&#8221; the girl said, hand still over her face, fingers parted so she could see through them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  For me too.  All smothering and stuff.  I had to yell at her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they wanted to yell at her too.  Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.  &#8220;But you lead the way.  I go behind.  And I&#8217;ll use a practice so I can escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded back.  Then she reached out, toward the big stick.</p>
<p>He let her take it, and let her lead him by holding the stick.</p>
<p>He used his free hand and, lacking paper, drew on the back of his hand.  A bit of an emergency way of escaping.</p>
<p>And, after they&#8217;d walked for ten minutes, into the valley by the ski hill, east of town, Avery Kelly stepped out, and immediately sat herself down on the grass, hands held out.  &#8220;No weapons, nothing on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Dom.  We never really talked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not really.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dom was a good pick,&#8221; Avery told the girl who&#8217;d had the bunny mask.</p>
<p>The girl peered through her fingers, and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An offer for a deal.  But it&#8217;s really up to you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I write it down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; the girl who&#8217;d had the rabbit mask said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically&#8230; I&#8217;ve had a good rest, head&#8217;s clear, and I&#8217;ve been thinking.  I can get you guys where you want to be.  But it&#8217;s really up to you.  Because it&#8217;s either going to be all of you&#8230; or just the group who are sitting back, wondering what to do.  Like your family.  And the Graubards, and the Conrads.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was scribbling on the paper.  As Dom turned to look at her, she held the paper up to shield her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, you could put the mask back on,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in Rome&#8230;&#8221; the girl said.  &#8220;Learned that line on TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dom turned to Avery.  &#8220;The Graubards aren&#8217;t part of this anymore.  They got stuck in the new version of this town.  By some of the other group.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think it&#8217;s going to be the second option, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the other side behind?  The militant practitioners?  Even knowing the consequences, that it might cause problems down the road?</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t sure he understood all this, and it was all full of contradictions, but&#8230; if it meant getting out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<hr />
<p>Avery let herself into her house, making it in about a foot before running into the press of people there.  Uncle Declan was getting Breanne ready to go, and there were adults in the doorways, with Sheridan sitting on the stairs.  About half of everyone present were still in the clothes they&#8217;d slept in.</p>
<p>Her mom and dad stood in the doorway to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Augh.  The <em>look</em> they gave her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re just in time to say goodbye,&#8221; Aunt Clara said, with a faint air of condemnation.  &#8220;Did you enjoy your morning run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I- running was mostly fine.  You&#8217;re going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to beat the rush, see if we can get back at a reasonable hour,&#8221; Uncle Declan said.  &#8220;Wish we could&#8217;ve talked more, skates.  That&#8217;s what Rowan calls you, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, and yeah, for sure.  Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk hockey next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully Queef pulls his head out of his behind and we can have <em>nice</em> things to say about hockey, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Manners, Declan,&#8221; Aunt Clara said.  &#8220;The little ones are over in the other room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they know what queef means then that&#8217;s your fault.  Breanne, if you&#8217;re going to take that long to lace up your boots, just leave them untied and do it in the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.  Hey Avery?  What was up with the stick thing?  You just got out of bed in the middle of the night and left some sticks on your end?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Breanne.  Look at what you&#8217;re doing or just leave them untied,&#8221; Uncle Declan groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, that was a project my friend did.  I took my stuff as I snuck out and left that behind,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t have been on the bed with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many things wrong with that.  You&#8217;re up and about in the middle of the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, Clara.  Let us parent our own daughter?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may want to parent Kerry then, because she&#8217;s banging her head on the table again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a minute.  Goodbyes first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, actually,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Jasmine&#8217;s coming by, she had something to say about traffic and the construction just north of town.  It might be hard or dangerous to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How hard?&#8221; her mom asked, with a faint note of alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just&#8230; there was a thing.  Car totaled.  People possibly hurt.  Or worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; her mom said, voice soft.  &#8220;You weren&#8217;t-?  You weren&#8217;t part of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw it from a distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may want to stay, Declan,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>Uncle Declan looked like he really didn&#8217;t want to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;You figure that out.  I&#8217;ll be right back, let me drop off some stuff,&#8221; Avery said, as she ducked past to the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They <em>have</em> to let us out,&#8221; Uncle Declan insisted.</p>
<p>As Avery ran past Sheridan, Sheridan slapped Avery&#8217;s butt.  Avery made it up another step before Sheridan grabbed her ankle, making her fall awkwardly on the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta hit me back or I look like an asshole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You kinda do anyway.&#8221;  Avery lightly smacked the back of Sheridan&#8217;s head, producing a bit of a laugh from Sheridan.</p>
<p>Avery wasn&#8217;t really in a mood to laugh, though.  There was a lot going on.</p>
<p>Declan was gone, presumably at school.  Which Kerry should be as well, now that she thought about it.  But she was in the other room?</p>
<p>She closed the door with her foot and pulled Snowdrop out of her bag, rusty fork clamped in her teeth.  &#8220;Bangnut, Bangnut, Bangnut.  Asap, Uncle Declan&#8217;s green Hamakua.  Don&#8217;t let him leave.  You pass that on, handle it, Snow?  Cherry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop sneezed.</p>
<p>Avery pulled the window open, let Snowdrop out, and then paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blow it up or anything.  Keep him from leaving <em>to keep him safe</em>.  No fire, no crashes, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sneeze.</p>
<p>Avery closed the window, got things together, ran a comb through her hair, and got her laptop plugged in and started up for later.  Then she hurried back downstairs.</p>
<p>Kyle was hugging Breanne goodbye, with Caleb apparently having already said goodybe.  Avery took her turn after he was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Email,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m serious.  Stay in touch.  We&#8217;re family, we have each other&#8217;s backs.  You, me, Kyle, Caleb, at the very least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  For sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re family, family looks after family,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that too loud,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom whispered, as Avery went over to her.  Her mom hugged her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll start a fight between your dad and Uncle Sean again,&#8221; her mom whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom!  Dad!  They&#8217;re leaving!&#8221; Kyle shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make it sound like I&#8217;m going to throw my gloves off and duel him,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see that,&#8221; Sheridan said, face pressed against the bars of the railing of the stairs.  &#8220;I think Uncle Sean would win, sorry dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s dad checked the coast was clear.  &#8220;I just want him to recognize that we&#8217;re doing a <em>lot</em> more to take care of Grumble&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, after,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said.  She squeezed Avery&#8217;s shoulders.  &#8220;You okay?  You&#8217;re good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, yeah.  Is it okay that Jasmine&#8217;s coming?  She wants to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.  Is it okay that Uncle Declan is leaving?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom looked bewildered.</p>
<p>But more family came through, and it was a slow procession past the front door, family crowding in together.  Conversations Avery knew her mom and dad wanted to have were postponed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the little ones said goodbye?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did a circuit around the table,&#8221; Aunt Tracy said.  &#8220;You might want to check on Kerry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to bring them out, saying goodbyes takes half an hour as is,&#8221; Uncle Declan said.</p>
<p>Breanne waved, standing on her toes to keep the wave visible past the press of people.</p>
<p>Avery waved back, then after doing the goofy thing where everyone waved until the car was out of sight, passed into the dining room.  Grumble was sitting in his armchair, watching some angry looking news people, and Kerry, Rhys, Maura, and Gareth were sitting around the table that was still folded out to its full length from Thanksgiving dinner.  Little homeschool workbooks and resource packets were spread out around them.</p>
<p>Kerry was banging her forehead repeatedly against the table&#8217;s surface.  Avery put her hand between forehead and wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have gone to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The more miserable you act, the more they win,&#8221; Avery confided.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I should get to stay from school if Sheridan and you are getting to.  Which I should, but then they made me do this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this how you act at school?&#8221; Aunt Clara asked.  &#8220;Look how good the other three are being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we hang out later?&#8221; Kerry asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to, but-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hang out now, Avery,&#8221; Aunt Clara said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got Caleb doing workbooks that are a few years younger than is appropriate for him, but I&#8217;m setting strict time limits.  Speed math, you should know these things, snap snap snap.  I can do the same for you.  Where <em>is</em> Caleb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he ran away,&#8221; Sheridan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should run,&#8221; Kerry whispered to Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery, can we talk to you in the backyard!?&#8221; her mom called out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Sheridan said.  &#8220;So what the hell, Ave, did you murder someone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder!?&#8221;  Kerry perked up.  Like the prospect of murder was better than homeschool.</p>
<p>&#8220;You left last night and now they&#8217;re super serious?  What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not murder- not me that murdered, no-&#8221; Avery stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not <em>you</em> that murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you murder me?&#8221; Kerry asked.  &#8220;So I don&#8217;t have to do homework?  Then you run.  You&#8217;re fast at running.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Tracy came into the kitchen, and immediately went to Maura&#8217;s chair, where Maura was working diligently.  She began combing fingers through Maura&#8217;s hair, which made the kid smile.  Aunt Clara did the opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of fussing over my daughter, you could go get your son and make sure he&#8217;s studying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.  It&#8217;s a long weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery slipped into the backyard while things were ongoing.</p>
<p>A moment to breathe, which ended up being half a breath, because her parents came out, closing the door behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re okay?&#8221; her mom asked.  &#8220;No injuries?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m okay, I said before.  I can&#8217;t lie, remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the car accident?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a whole other thing.  I don&#8217;t know exactly how to say it all, but I think some really bad stuff is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad stuff?&#8221; her mom asked, voice pitched higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like&#8230; the guy we were trying to stop?  Musser?  He wanted to take over, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to fight back, kind of, someone <em>else</em> unleashed a <em>lot</em> of hostile Others on Ontario.  And we don&#8217;t know the full story with that, but Musser backed off.  So we kind of won, temporarily, which is good, and we&#8217;re safe, kind of, which is also good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a whole lot of people are dying.  Including the people I saw in the car.  Which got speared by a giant bird man and carried off into the horizon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mom didn&#8217;t laugh this time, which was a relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jasmine&#8217;s coming to touch base, Lucy&#8217;s managing some other stuff but she&#8217;ll swing by.  Verona&#8217;s doing the final steps for her magic house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you say a lot of people are dying-?  Magic people?  Innocents?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, fully.  Could be some areas are different.  Others are all different.  It&#8217;s part of why I came home, I wanted to get my laptop and ask some people who know better.  And figure out what to do because a lot of the people who were invading are sorta stuck here now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My head is spinning,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours and mine both,&#8221; Avery admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Uncle Declan going to be safe?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I- I hope so.  I got Snowdrop to get a gremlin to sabotage his car.  I- hm.  That&#8217;s not quite as bad as it sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We trust you,&#8221; her dad said.  &#8220;At least until you give us more reason to <em>distrust</em> you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t trust anything,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;What is this world we&#8217;re living in?  It all feels like a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s-&#8221; Avery paused.  &#8220;If you wanted to tell yourself it&#8217;s a dream, I think the universe would help you with that.  You&#8217;d just have to let it happen.  Dad would have to let you let it happen, or join in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of mother would I be if I did that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  A happy, sane one?  One that I can go back to if I need a rock?  Some stability?&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea struck Avery that this would forever be a <em>thing</em>, now, if her mom didn&#8217;t take the out.  If she could.  That this would hang over every conversation, it would taint everything, it would make home <em>not a home</em>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d already experienced that.  She looked at her dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look tired,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Been running around all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you get a chance to rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  I gotta- there&#8217;s so much to do.  Emailing Zed and Nicolette, maybe Jude&#8230; fuck.  I screwed up the Jude thing- I&#8217;ll tell you more of that later.  We&#8217;ve got the sixty or seventy practitioners still in town, and I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re going to react or what they&#8217;re going to do.  They&#8217;re regrouping, and figuring things out.  Figuring out how to get home, what&#8217;s going on with all that.  If maybe the Others that got sicced on Ontario are hurting all innocents, or hurting just practitioners, or just <em>those</em> practitioners?  There&#8217;s the newly founded Kennet, uh, the Charles thing.  Um, there&#8217;s <em>you guys</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Avery said, bewildered and lost.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what <em>I</em> should do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Protein bars.  Jasmine&#8217;s bringing stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it is, it&#8217;ll last about half a second in this household,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could sleep,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I- no.  There&#8217;s too much to do.  I gotta- I turned my laptop on, I should get it.  If I figure out more about what&#8217;s going on, I can wrap my head around this.  If Jasmine comes, maybe bring her around back?  Fend off the family?  Give me space to&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>Her mom didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p>Avery went back inside, past the very full dining room, and upstairs.  The ugly feeling chased her, that if it was even possible to safely get back to Thunder Bay, the dynamic might change.  If it was like it was here, after she&#8217;d come out&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Water?&#8221; Kerry asked.  &#8220;Let me get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay seated, focus on your schoolwork.  Are you this antsy in actual school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it, give me thirty seconds to a minute,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>If it was like that at Thunder Bay, what would that even look like?  What would that be like?  What could she even do?  If her mom couldn&#8217;t accept it all?</p>
<p>An impulse came from Snowdrop.  Not a word, but a generalized feeling: fire and opossum chaos.</p>
<p><em>You didn&#8217;t actually set the car on fire, did you? </em>Avery thought, pushing the question and her concern toward Snowdrop.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>She got the laptop and carried it downstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot about burying bodies from the shows I&#8217;ve been watching,&#8221; Sheridan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  Hmm.  Will keep that in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery got the water and brought it to Kerry, glancing over Kerry&#8217;s shoulder, then went outside, shutting the door and seating herself in one of the reclining patio chairs.  &#8220;I think Uncle Declan&#8217;s car ran into some trouble, so he might be coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that, huh?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not <em>just like that</em>, really.  I had to do a big ritual to connect to Snowdrop, because she would&#8217;ve died in a few years if I&#8217;d left things alone, and I brought her into existence, kind of.  And developing a relationship with the goblins, that&#8217;s a thing, and then figuring out how to coordinate&#8230;&#8221; Avery said, absently, as she logged in and waited for the Wi-fi.  Other devices in the house were eating up the connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many things have you done to keep secrets from us?  Or manipulate us?  Slow us down or turn us around if we&#8217;re doing something?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>Avery looked up.  &#8220;Mostly connection blocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Means, uh.  I make it easier to ignore me.  Or ignore magic stuff.  So I can go out and do what I need to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think I get what Jasmine was saying, now, when she said she was scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery checked her email.  There were three from Zed.  One asking for information.  Then outlining what he knew about some of the big Others.</p>
<p>Zed had been asked about some Technomancy Others that had taken a Lordship.  They&#8217;d taken over a call center.  He was pretty sure it was a <i>bái làn</i>, <em>or &#8216;White Rot&#8217;, or a <i>bái mù</i></em>, or &#8216;White Eye&#8217;, both of which were related technomancy Others that focused on generating nonsense and stirring upset, then drinking in the confusion and upset to alter its proximate reality.  Having taken over the call center, it was infecting people with the white eyes or white rot, spamming the township with nonstop repeated calls and drinking in power.</p>
<p>The Lord of that area had sealed themselves in their home, using protections to keep trouble out, but were unable to do anything except keep those wards up.  The power that was taken in by the incessant spam and nonsense calls was being channeled into and against the seals and wards, gradually wearing them down.  Either the practitioner would lose concentration and collapse, or their best efforts would stop being useful, and the White Rot would work its way inside and get them.</p>
<p>Zed was asking if he should go.  Initial plan was to go there after he&#8217;d handled the- wait.</p>
<p>Wait, no, these were in reverse order, of course, most recent email at the top.</p>
<p>Avery shook her head.  She was tired.</p>
<p>The first email was a general update.  It mostly told Avery what she already knew.  Still, it was verification.  A lot of practitioners, many of them third-string, had just been executed.</p>
<p>Avery took down the names.</p>
<p>Second email, very in depth.  Zed was focused heavily on the big threat.  A ritual incarnate had arisen about halfway between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg.  Dryden was a town about the size Kennet had been, and a force around Dryden was turning people into places and objects into people.  Each of the five thousand residents were unspooled into hallways, roads, and other things, and the various things they wore and had with them became people.</p>
<p>Practitioners, Zed wrote, were able to hold onto themselves, just a bit, but they unspooled easily if hurt or- Avery guessed it was coup.  Any insult, any setback, it&#8217;d be a knock against their ability to keep from unspooling and becoming more <em>place</em>.  Too much of a knock against their Selves and they&#8217;d become an ongoing fixture.</p>
<p>But implements retained the connection, at least, with memories and limited abilities of the practitioner, Others were mostly unaffected, and a full outfit of complementary pieces of clothing would become a team of people who associated with each other but didn&#8217;t remember a life before the Ritual Incarnate.  Before what Zed was calling a Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Oh, and the same dangerous Others that were out here were in there.  Mostly occupying themselves killing the Lord and his family members that had been camped out there, at the far west of Musser&#8217;s territory.</p>
<p>Leaving Zed to theorize about how it might be tackled.  Summoned Others to give guidance, a very specific sort of outfit, for a goal-oriented, cohesive team- Zed theorized hyper-urban tactical clothing for a tactical squad.  Any practitioners with implements would be ideal.  All to get to what Zed was thinking was a core of power that was still vulnerable.</p>
<p>Avery sat back, thinking.</p>
<p><em>don&#8217;t go</em>, she typed.  She sent that fast, so Zed wouldn&#8217;t commit to anything in the meantime.</p>
<p>Then, while she was typing a follow up message, she got a reply: <em>why</em> <em>not?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Telling Zed&#8230; Don&#8217;t go, because Charles Abrams created the Hungry Choir as a trap for Alexander and the other big practitioners.  It had a big juicy battery full of power at the center, basically,&#8221; Avery said out loud, as she typed.  For her parents&#8217; benefit.  &#8220;And this thing Zed is telling me about might be Charles&#8217; second try at that.  Hold off for now.  Maybe you should tackle the Others who took over the call center.  Whatever that&#8217;s about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds serious,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise mentioned a Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.  And Charles might be listening and watching as we speak, because he&#8217;s kind of omniscient within his domain.  Kind of, and he&#8217;s not friendly,&#8221; Avery said, as she double checked what Zed had typed for any clues and then backed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Omniscient.  Okay,&#8221; her mom said.  She looked up at the sky.  &#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she did that nervous laugh again.</p>
<p>Avery went back to her email inbox, where she&#8217;d had some scattered other messages.  Nicolette, old messages from when she&#8217;d been trying to communicate what Wye had been passing on, on the phone call.  Nothing new there, just concern and help being offered.  Now new messages from Nicolette, asking for any information she had.  Including about the practitioners who were stuck in Kennet.</p>
<p>And two more messages that had come in while she&#8217;d been checking the others.  One from Jude&#8217;s dad.  Jude was back and what the hell was going on.  One from Ann Wint back in Thunder Bay.  Asking what the hell was going on, did Avery have any information?</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s kind of freaking out.  Day just started and they&#8217;re wondering what just happened,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Jude, Zed, Nicolette, Ann from Thunder Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ann?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the women who stood at the end of the driveway when you arrived?  She&#8217;s a practitioner, a pretty dangerous one,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a council back home.  Of practitioners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is there?  Okay,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm.  I should reply to all of these, but there&#8217;s more questions than answers.  I really wanted answers to bring to the meeting later.  Because we&#8217;ve got a lot of hostile practitioners and they probably want this info.  Hmmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasmine, at the side gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, hey,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s mom said, cheering up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to the front door and they said it would be easier to go around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of people in the house.  Maybe.  Hi, come on through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy was with her mom.</p>
<p>Avery hurried off to fire off two quick emails.  One to Raquel:</p>
<p><em>your uncle left this morning, claim abandoned but he plans to return.<br />
a lot of crap went down.<br />
every lord in the region just got userped sounds like.<br />
hope you&#8217;re okay. stay in touch.</em></p>
<p>And then Fernanda.</p>
<p><em>musser abandoned the claim attempt.  he will try again<br />
a lot of crap is happening.<br />
if we can talk again now might be a good time.<br />
hope you&#8217;re okay.<br />
</em></p>
<p>&#8220;How are we doing?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  Lots of people with questions.  Big ritual incarnate turning people into roads and clothing into people or something?  Call center Others murdering the local Lord.  No reply yet from Raquel.  I hope she wasn&#8217;t put in charge as a Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucy replied.  &#8220;If there&#8217;s any upside to how her uncle treats her like shit, I think it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s not very likely he&#8217;d make her do that, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gathering, we&#8217;ve agreed to a truce for the next meeting, standard rules of hospitality,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Went to Miss and got some special permission to stay, for the ones who already agreed to leave and stay away.  Circumstances were this, they&#8217;ve changed, we make no attempt to gainsay or forswear, blah blah blah.  But we&#8217;re going to have a meeting with two classrooms worth of adults who aren&#8217;t our biggest fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we know if it&#8217;s safe to travel?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Hm.  Nicolette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Ask.  But some people might already be reaching out to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wye, probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Avery fired off an email asking Nicolette if she knew.</p>
<p>Jasmine had brought a huge box of donuts and breakfast sandwiches, and she had a bag of drinks.  Avery peered over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;One vegetarian breakfast sandwich, Lucy reminded me,&#8221; Jasmine said, pointing.</p>
<p>Avery gratefully took it, along with one donut she held with a napkin to avoid getting glaze on herself.  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then to Lucy, she added, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery took a bite with one hand while scrolling.  Alfalfa sprouts, hash browns, avocado, on brioche.</p>
<p>There&#8217;d been four replies in the intervening time.</p>
<p>More people freaking out, more people trying to find information, or get in touch.  Zed reporting two more instances of Others that Raymond had heard of and been asked to deal with.  And one more report from people concerned or intrigued about the Ritual Incarnate.  Which was slowly moving.</p>
<p>There was a Lordship that had been overtaken by a whole contingent of bogeymen.  Thirty in all.  All dressed nice, all with bags over their heads, fanged mouths drawn at random places on the bags.  Thirty bogeymen against one Lord and the two people who&#8217;d been staying with the Lord.  The Lord had been neatly butchered, then served as meat cupcakes, meat aperitif and skin sandwiches, with blood tea, for a big gathering, the two other local practitioners in attendance, tied to their chairs and made to eat and drink their friend.  The belief was that they&#8217;d be the next two things served at teatime.</p>
<p>The practitioners hadn&#8217;t even been awake when the bogeymen had come after them.</p>
<p>And another Lordship, a cursed item under a ward had gotten free.  A cursed scalpel, it found an insecure host and let them become beautiful by scarring and cutting off people&#8217;s best features.  It was allegedly heavily tied into the Abyss and much like a bogeyman, if the user was defeated, it would be dropped, lost, dip into the Abyss, and then resurface in short order.</p>
<p>Except it had been supercharged or something because three different wielders had been defeated in the span of an hour, the scalpel slipping away each time, until finally a little boy with a craniofacial deformity he was probably insecure about had gotten to the practitioner, slicing the back of their ankles open as they&#8217;d been standing by their car, then cutting the skin off their heads, leaving them to bleed out.</p>
<p>And the scalpel had been dropped, left to go back to one of the original wielders from earlier in the day, who had claimed the Lordship throne uncontested.</p>
<p>Avery wondered what happened to the little boy after that.  Could he go home?  What would his parents say?  What was the story?</p>
<p>Lucy was looking over her shoulder.  She moved the laptop so Lucy could see it better.</p>
<p>Then she typed a message, awkwardly, because of the angle of the keyboard.</p>
<p><em>be careful.  Carmine Exile knows who you and Ray are.  He knows you&#8217;ll be sent to some of these.</em></p>
<p>That got a thumbs up and a sunglasses smiley face in return.</p>
<p>Lucy pushed the laptop back around to its normal angle for Avery.  &#8220;I wonder if Charles is keeping the door open for the bogeymen.  Normally they go back, and it&#8217;s a question of if they can come back soon, if they&#8217;re angry enough, you know?  And certain places will resist them coming back unless it&#8217;s an anniversary or there&#8217;s some reason, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Something like that.  Keeping the door open &#8211; you mean, like, if they go to the Abyss, it&#8217;s the opposite of there being resistance to coming back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just&#8230; come back whenever, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  That&#8217;s spooky.  There was this one, thirty bogeymen, apparently, as part of a linked network.  All eating people for tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating<em> people</em>?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;This is a lot of scary stuff happening all of a sudden.&#8221;</p>
<p>She checked Ann&#8217;s email.  From the sounds of it, Thunder Bay was okay.  That was good.  If Florin had taken over, what would&#8217;ve happened?  Would it have been hit by something big and bad?</p>
<p>A message came back from Nicolette: <em>Cards say travel will be safe for you.  Not for Musser&#8217;s allies</em>.</p>
<p><em>Thanks</em>, Avery replied.  She looked up at Lucy.  &#8220;That&#8217;s positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might want to talk to Chuck anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  She looked in her mom&#8217;s direction.  &#8220;I think we&#8217;re safe to leave.  And to let Uncle Declan go.  I hope Bangnut didn&#8217;t do too much damage to the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sicced Bangnut on the car?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I called him and sent Snowdrop to help.  I just thought- anything we tried to do with words wouldn&#8217;t work, and&#8230; yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, uh, okay,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Avery took another bite of the breakfast sandwich while she thought.</p>
<p>More messages.</p>
<p>More situations.</p>
<p>Avery took notes as best as she could, trying to balance the laptop and notepad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geez, you get a lot of emails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;People are trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s going to get even worse later,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Because we gotta meet those guys again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery took down more names, and Lordships where the names weren&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>It was hard to get her thoughts in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery,&#8221; her dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221; she replied, finishing writing down one name before looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said the car got totaled.  Carried off by a bird man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re talking about all these deaths.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh.  She could see where this was going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many people have you- have you seen die?&#8221;</p>
<p>The look from her mom and dad was penetrating.  The look from Jasmine was so serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Handful.  It gets fuzzy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuzzy?  Fuzzy how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuzzy like&#8230; sometimes they&#8217;re Others and they don&#8217;t exactly, uh&#8230; die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some come back.  Or get sent somewhere else when their bodies blow up and then come back.  Or they&#8217;re&#8230; fleeting existences, I guess?&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Liberty and America Tedd have goblin magic and sometimes that magic just&#8230; makes a thinking, breathing, talking goblin and those goblins just&#8230; spring into existence and die, I guess,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;A lot of stuff gets weird.  Like the Foundlings and stuff.  The weird people in Kennet found.  They didn&#8217;t exist before this morning.  But they exist now, with memories and lives and identities and roles and weirdness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean their lives don&#8217;t matter?&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-&#8221; Lucy started to answer, then shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want their lives to matter.  But I&#8217;m worried because we had to let Anthem Tedd go and he went on a bloody <em>rampage</em>, you know?  We couldn&#8217;t really fight him to stop him and we aren&#8217;t strong enough so&#8230; what do we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise should be answering that, not you,&#8221; Jasmine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;And she and Toadswallow and Miss agreed to let him go but&#8230; does that mean we&#8217;re devaluing those lives by letting the killer go free?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more worried about you,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;Because I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out what to do about Declan.  His video games, desensitization.  Most of it seems okay, so long as I mind the age ratings more, we set boundaries, we encourage other interests and socialization, hopefully we can get him to a better place.  But then, taking those same lessons with you?  Desensitization?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that desensitized,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m just&#8230; better at moving forward than I was after the first one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gabriel Necaise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t recognize that name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eaten by the Hungry Choir.  Forgotten by everyone.  Even his own mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise mentioned the choir,&#8221; Jasmine said.</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.</p>
<p>The emails just kept coming in.  There was this conversation, that still felt like walking on eggshells, but the emails were like the world trying to tell her that alarm bells were ringing and everything was going wrong, and she was misusing her time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re wonderful,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;You talk about saving lives and trying to do good and I believe you.  But for the idea of life and death to get that fuzzy?  The idea of the long term effects of that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I asked for it,&#8221; Avery told him.</p>
<p>Her mom leaned forward.  &#8220;It&#8217;s got me thinking a lot about the times you&#8217;ve seemed tired, or down.  Defeated, even.  You&#8217;ve got your friends and it&#8217;s clear you love them, but I&#8217;m worried now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The elbow injury this summer?  Was that because of all of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?  How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s mouth opened, and she made a small croaking sound, when she couldn&#8217;t find the words.  &#8220;Cop.  Which was possessed by a body snatcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  How does that connect- I just want the connective tissue.  Is there a point where it clicks and I know the timeline?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;ll go over stuff with you later, if you want,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t even explain it in a breath, it&#8217;s- what is it doing to you mentally?  You&#8217;re not a soldier.  No wonder you&#8217;re wiped out, drained, defeated,&#8221; Avery&#8217;s dad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was tired of life and defeated before,&#8221; Avery replied.  &#8220;At least now I&#8217;m doing something good.  We did something big here and we gotta&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She trailed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be for nothing, if Musser leaves and comes back prepared, with a full read on everything,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Avery frowned.  &#8220;Maybe.  We gotta make it more than nothing  We gotta invest in this, work with it, we gotta handle this stuff, but that takes time and energy and I&#8217;m not even living in Kennet anymore&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would feel so much better if you rested,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;After.  I gotta- other stuff.  After.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should go,&#8221; Lucy said, quiet.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be safe,&#8221; her dad said.  &#8220;For the love of God, please, be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery logged out on her laptop, leaving the password screen up, then closed it.  &#8220;Can you put this in my room and plug it in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; her mom said.  &#8220;I want to have a long talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I know.  I just gotta- I gotta do a bunch of stuff and then sleep and&#8230; more stuff, then after.  I dunno if you want to go with Sheridan back home, let me come on my own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Absolutely not, I don&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ll lie to the school if I have to,&#8221; her mom said, taking the laptop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Avery said, quiet.  &#8220;Can I take a donut for my opossum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s milk too,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Avery got the milk.</p>
<p>She walked with Lucy down to the grass by the back porch, double checking nobody could see.  Lucy&#8217;s mom got up too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, the others brought up good points before,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;That some of these people might be able to break past the truce.  If they do, we can escape, but that gets a lot harder if I have to get you out too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to stay?&#8221; her mom asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasmine sat back down, forehead all scrunched together.  Their parents were all together, sitting on a grouping of patio chairs, Avery&#8217;s dad with a blanket on his lap since he was still in sleep clothes.</p>
<p>They were all looking down at them, so worried.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t want this to be some supernatural version of what had happened with her dad and coming out.  Where it felt like it poisoned everything or lowered tolerances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to next?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kennet found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need Snow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can find her way there.  She&#8217;s good at navigating realms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss,&#8221; they said together.</p>
<p>Wind stirred the leaves, and the leaves swirled around them.  A careful block of their parents&#8217; ability to see them, and their ability to see the area, and they were in Kennet found.</p>
<p><em>Come, Snowdrop, I have</em> <em>milk</em>, Avery thought.  Then she broke into a run, because she wanted to get away from that melancholy feeling and the worries about what Thunder Bay would be like.</p>
<p>Their parents weren&#8217;t okay.  They were <em>so worried, </em>there was so much and so much of that stuff would only make them more worried.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>&#8220;We have obligations!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell that to Musser, don&#8217;t get mad at us.  You decided to come here for whatever reason,&#8221; Lucy retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re clever, extorting us?&#8221; a woman asked.  She was rangy, with skin that had scarred over from acne years ago, then cleared up, and split ends in her hair.  &#8220;Our family members are supposedly hurt or dead, and you&#8217;re threatening us?  Keeping us from leaving?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not us,&#8221; Lucy said, voice firm.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not with Charles, not intentionally, not like you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of your family-&#8221; Avery started.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re using this situation to your advantage.  We were told about this Abyssal faerie god whatever it is, and how she&#8217;s in league with the Carmine Exile, but not officially.  Isn&#8217;t it the same with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shook her head.  &#8220;No, not really!  Believe it or not, we kind of don&#8217;t want everyone murdered, which, speaking of-!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you swear you had no responsibility?&#8221; a man asked.  One of the Songetays.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, because we all have <em>some</em> degree of responsibility,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dodging, you can&#8217;t even give us a straight answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be cornered into swearing something that could be twisted around to be a forswearing, especially after seeing the bullshit Musser pulled with the judges, to get his gainsaying down.  No,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;I knew Charles was up to something-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on a first name basis with the Carmine Exile?&#8221; the Songetay asked, affecting a tone like he&#8217;d scored some victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you.  I knew him before, I tried harder to stop him than any of you did.  I knew he had a plan, I didn&#8217;t know it was this.  That&#8217;s as far as my responsibility goes, as I see it.  We <em>did not</em> want this.  All we really wanted was to be left alone.  Musser is using this as an excuse to take over &#8211; if he really wanted to stop Charles he&#8217;d <em>stop Charles.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>As the discussion continued, Avery took a few steps forward.  Lucy&#8217;s hand went out, as if she wanted to grab for Avery and stop her, but then the hand dropped.</p>
<p>Avery crossed the no-man&#8217;s land between their group and the group in front of the cabin.  She held out a paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terms?&#8221; Elizabeth Driscoll asked.  She took the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Names.  Preliminary research.  I thought you guys would want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; Elizabeth asked, looking at Mr. Songetay.</p>
<p>He nodded once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dryden, Ontario, far western Lordship of Musser territory.  Overtaken by ritual incarnate.  Practitioners are incommunicado, according to Zed Sadler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably dead,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he trustworthy?  This Zed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust Zed,&#8221; Elizabeth replied.</p>
<p>Mr. Songetay nodded again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was there?&#8221; someone asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jorge Davis.  Friend of Anthem,&#8221; Mr. Songetay said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he have an implement?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Songetay shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That apparently helps with this ritual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alta Abner, Nipigon.  Another western territory,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;Milly Legendre&#8217;s cousin.  Married into the family, didn&#8217;t take the family name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh fuck,&#8221; someone in the crowd said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty bogeymen?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  &#8220;Allegedly.  All linked together.  Two people were with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kids,&#8221; that same someone from the crowd said.  &#8220;Was it quick?  Do we know?  Are the kids at least okay in the meantime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a lot,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were bogeymen,&#8221; a man with a deeper voice said.  &#8220;They were bogeymen with an <em>intent</em>, so I don&#8217;t imagine it was quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you stand in our way?&#8221; the woman from before asked.  &#8220;If you&#8217;d just let this pass without contest, we could&#8217;ve been on our way back, we could&#8217;ve been ready days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think you could&#8217;ve,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you even know?&#8221; the woman asked.  &#8220;Seriously?  What do you know?  You&#8217;re a child, what do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teenagers,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a child, you&#8217;re pitiful, stupid children, you slowed us down when it counted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carry on?&#8221; Lucy asked Elizabeth.  &#8220;We might as well know what we&#8217;re up against.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, don&#8217;t carry on, Liz.  Fuck you, you child.  What do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t productive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you,&#8221; the woman said.  There were tears in her eyes.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t carry on, Liz.  I don&#8217;t want to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good few people do,&#8221; Elizabeth replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mare has family in one Lordship,&#8221; someone said, quiet.  &#8220;Two nephews in Saul Ste. Marie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off.  No.  They- they&#8217;re capable.  They earned a Lordship over seventy thousand people, that&#8217;s not for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the Saul Ste. Marie Lordship on there?&#8221; the man with the deeper voice asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear it!&#8221; the woman raised her voice.  It wasn&#8217;t just a shouty voice either.  It was a raised voice with a raised pitch and note of alarm to it that kind of penetrated, like, <em>normal</em>.  The idea of normal.  Normal rules for talking and shouting.</p>
<p>Avery wasn&#8217;t that good at facing down this many people who really disliked her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had given a sign, because the woman <em>transformed</em>.  She wheeled on the two of them, and was stopped by Mr. Songetay.  &#8220;Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck your part in this!  Fuck you for getting me dragged out here, when I could have been there for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had been, and if you being there was enough to matter, then I think Char- the Carmine Exile would have sent something stronger,&#8221; Lucy replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck off, fuck your justifications-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a justification.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; Avery said, quiet.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not about being right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s not about being right, but if America Tedd can f-word your attempt to call for help-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say my damn name,&#8221; America called out.</p>
<p>&#8220;-and if goblin insults with physical blows can curse someone, I don&#8217;t want to stand here and take abuse.  We have a truce, we&#8217;re talking this out, get her to chill out, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you!&#8221; the woman shouted.</p>
<p>Mr. Songetay put a hand on the woman&#8217;s shoulder, then gripped tight when she turned on him, like she wanted to fight.  But he thrust her toward the back of the crowd, and motioned to someone.</p>
<p>Two boys escorted the woman back and away.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?  Who did it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the bound Other, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Eugene Legendre asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Avery answered, while Elizabeth went back to reading the list to check.</p>
<p>&#8220;What other?&#8221; the woman asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folded wraith,&#8221; Elizabeth read.  &#8220;Prather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221; Eugene said.  &#8220;We were going to check on that one&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out the &#8216;one&#8217; into a groany &#8216;uh&#8217; sound, counting on his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine days,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the minor and moderate wardings failed,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole smattering right in the middle of that page.  From what I got through emails, from Zed and Nicolette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were worried about what might happen if a bunch of the key Legendres got gainsaid all at once.  Might weaken the family,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That and-or power got pushed into the prisoners, and they broke out of their cages,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Eugene nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How bad?  What the hell is a Prather?&#8221; the woman asked.  She looked hollowed-out.</p>
<p>Not all that different from how worried Avery&#8217;s parents had looked.  Except she lived on the far end of that worry, after the worst had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you didn&#8217;t want to know, now you want to know?&#8221; someone asked, raising their voice.  &#8220;Some of us are waiting for news.  Most of us- we&#8217;ve been calling, we can&#8217;t get answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; the woman said, again, talking over the protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tell her,&#8221; Liz said, turning to Avery.  &#8220;You barely wrote anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Eugene said.  &#8220;Strong wraith, spawned off a man who was a monster long before he was Other.  Kept people in cages that would&#8217;ve been too small for people half their size.  Like a sick experiment.  The Wraith- it could more or less practice.  Just not well, its practice ran into the practice of some other people, it went bad.  Folded.  Plicate, corrugated, whatever you want to call it.  Horror-wraith.  With the ability to twist people and places up into horrors.  And then he just&#8230; carried on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me they&#8217;re dead, then,&#8221; the woman said, staring at the ground.  Two people had firm grips on her, as if prepared for the inevitable outburst.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>The woman melted down, moaning, groaning, no longer holding herself up.  The people who&#8217;d been holding her kept her upright.</p>
<p>They dragged her back toward the cabin.  Inside and away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bound it, because none of the Necromancers were willing to get anywhere close to it,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe edit what you&#8217;re saying?&#8221; Sutton asked.  &#8220;No need to go in depth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she&#8217;d want to know the details.  She was asking for the details.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edit what you&#8217;re saying, okay?  For the others?  There&#8217;s others on the list?&#8221; Sutton asked.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just that he made some strong Others.  He let Others out of wherever they were being caged and warded in?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;Seems like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t sound like a very good Other to be a Lord,&#8221; Sutton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not.  Not really,&#8221; Lucy answered.  &#8220;They aren&#8217;t there to be Lords.  They&#8217;re there to be nightmares to deal with.  They&#8217;re there to hold the throne while letting the Judges run things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Others we weren&#8217;t able or willing to deal with on good days,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ones he designed to mess with you all,&#8221; Avery added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fostras, Timmins Ontario, escaped their warding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never actually classified them,&#8221; Eugene said.  &#8220;They looked and scanned like normal people, you know?  Regular family, nice, nothing too unusual, fairly religious, but not weirdly so.  Regular God, no strange gods.  But they took a lot of people in, and one was a classmate of a practitioner over there.  The practitioner said she was one person to his Sight one day, then a completely different Self the next day, while looking and acting mostly the same.  Didn&#8217;t scan as Other.  Then when we got called in and tried binding them as an experiment, they stayed put, inside the house.  Didn&#8217;t starve despite never getting deliveries or leaving the property, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Nicolette, they&#8217;re free and walking around town like nothing&#8217;s weird,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;And the Lord of Timmins is living with them now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the Rowsomes,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, well&#8230; I wish I knew how bad that was,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offbreed, Lebel-sur-Quévillon,&#8221; Elizabeth went on.  &#8220;Small town.  Half this size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pig.  Oddfolk, but animal, not person,&#8221; Eugene said.  &#8220;Five headed pig, all mashed in there together, sharp teeth, <em>strong</em>.  About five hundred pounds, I&#8217;d guess.  Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord isn&#8217;t named.  It just says he was disembowled and dragged across town toward the woods, scared the shit out of the locals, but innocence wasn&#8217;t quite broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This feels like a litany of our failures,&#8221; Eugene said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kind of is,&#8221; Sutton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck no, we can&#8217;t be expected to do a maximum strength binding on every Other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck that.  No.  It takes resources, time, management.  And we barely get paid for that crap.  You guys have undervalued us for years, you&#8217;ve cut corners on paying, you&#8217;ve cut corners on the resources you give us, the <em>status</em>.  We&#8217;ve <em>regularly</em> told people that we&#8217;re doing this with shoestrings and pennies.  Now it goes wrong because of something unforseen?  Don&#8217;t fucking try to pin this on the Legendres.  Don&#8217;t you fucking <em>dare.</em>  Would you even try if my dad was still here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone took a picture of the list, to carry it to a group that could huddle around them and read as they scrolled.  Someone else took the same cue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you even here for?&#8221; a man asked Avery and Lucy.  The Others were standing a bit back, letting them act as representatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;To&#8230; work out something, so you don&#8217;t, you know, die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you.  What are your actual motives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To find a way forward, share information, figure out what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Avery answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no fucking <em>we</em>,&#8221; the retort came back.  &#8220;You fucking killed Milo Songetay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Milo came at me with intent to kill, and he got a duel with a Winter Fae instead,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Apparently Lucy was deciding to come clean, because the truth was better than the intimidation the half-truth provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have eyes that say he ran, and you went for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Winter Fae, not me-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You as a group, plural, all of you.  You worked together on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I&#8217;d run?  He would have chased.  Would you do anything except tut-tut your disapproval over the murder of a teenage girl?&#8221; Lucy asked, angry now.  &#8220;Because he was fast and I might not have gotten away.  So&#8230; if he was willing to murder me and come after me and he got the exact same thing turned back on him?  That&#8217;s <em>just</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was family,&#8221; Mr. Songetay said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for your loss,&#8221; Lucy told him.  &#8220;I mean that.  I&#8217;m not that sorry he died.  I am sorry that you feel loss, that you lost something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Songetay shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our understanding that if you try to travel normally, if you leave, then you&#8217;ll get attacked,&#8221; Avery said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of Others and my last text messages from Nicolette say most people are getting targeted right away.  Musser&#8217;s car has fended off some minor attacks but nothing as major as the rest are dealing with.  Every place that was a Musser Lordship is now very dangerous for you to be in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re prepared to offer you a kind of sanctuary,&#8221; Lucy said.  &#8220;Plus any support you may require.  But you have to leave us and our Others alone, you can&#8217;t interfere with the town, you can&#8217;t cause problems, and you can&#8217;t mess with Verona&#8217;s claim for Kennet found.  Basic hospitality stuff.  Which I think you&#8217;d agree is pretty fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants your hospitality?&#8221; America asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, I do?&#8221; Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Check with the family first, Liz,&#8221; Elizabeth&#8217;s dad said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re wrong, but let&#8217;s discuss, organize&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to throw some bullshit weird place at us?&#8221; America asked.  &#8220;Do what you want.  You were losing.  The only reason Musser walked away is he doesn&#8217;t think you matter that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t matter that much but he&#8217;ll bring all these people here?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the final territories?  Yeah.  Basically a celebration.  And we can have this town ready for him for when he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think my dad is right,&#8221; Elizabeth said.  &#8220;I think a discussion is in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Discuss what you want.  I&#8217;m going to do my thing.  If we can&#8217;t leave, we fight and take over.  So figure out how to get us where we want to be, or be prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk,&#8221; Elizabeth insisted, to Lucy and Avery.</p>
<p>Avery glanced back at Louise, who nodded and beckoned.</p>
<p>There was not much use continuing this.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221;</em> Lucy whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Avery said.  She looked over the group, and momentarily locked eyes with one of the Conrads, and then McCauleigh Hennigar, who moved her head in a faction of a nod.</p>
<p>But in the background, Cyn Gaspard stood with arms folded, ominous, and Angie Demarest was there, apart from the rest, like they were wary of her.  America Tedd was talking loudly, gathering some of the younger war-practitioners to her, Easton and the Legendre boys included, while others hung back in Elizabeth&#8217;s group.</p>
<p>It was gutting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may have to revoke the special permission,&#8221; Toadswallow said, as Avery and Lucy joined the Others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I hope not.  Might mean we have to find a way to send them back down to Kennet found,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an option,&#8221; Toadswallow said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could have gone worse,&#8221; Louise said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it have?&#8221; Avery asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen meetings go worse and turn out better.  Granted, not life or death, but&#8230; it&#8217;s something?&#8221; Louise offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; Louise asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next step of the plan?&#8221; Lucy asked, turning to Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next step of the plan, I guess,&#8221; Avery said, not enthused.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>She had to get her stuff.  But as she jogged down her driveway, she only saw the one car.</p>
<p>Had others gone somewhere for lunch?</p>
<p>The house was whisper-quiet.  The sink hissed, dishes being washed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dad turned, pressing a finger to his lips.  &#8220;Grumble&#8217;s sleeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded, gently closing the front door.  She peeked and saw him slumped over in his armchair, television muted.  Probably by her dad.  The usual angry looking guy had been replaced with an angry looking woman with a bad peroxide blonde haircut.</p>
<p>A lot of the workbooks on the dining table had been put away.  There were remnants of a snack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s mom?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Her dad handed her a cloth to dry with, and didn&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a lot, you know.  Magic.  Monsters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Others,&#8221; Avery corrected.  &#8220;Give me a straight answer, please?  Please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on her way back to Thunder Bay.  There was another spat with Uncle Sean and me, they left, then Aunt Clara decided she was going to leave right then.  You know?&#8221;</p>
<p>That kind of made sense.  Aunt Clara leaving when Uncle Sean did.</p>
<p>Avery nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your mom decided it was a good time to go.  Same direction, same rest stops.  Just in case.  You know?  Spur of the moment decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without me?  Are we doing that thing where I use magic to go after her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dad paused for just that half a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot, Avery.  She just needs a bit of time to come to terms with it.  A week or two, then we&#8217;ll reassess, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery stared up at him, studying his expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just scared,&#8221; her dad told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, hon.  But this is doable, okay?  This is absolutely not a final thing.  It&#8217;s like how your mom went to Thunder Bay and I stayed here, some tough decisions, but it&#8217;s everyone doing what they need to do.  It doesn&#8217;t mean she loves you any less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me a chance to stay here, handle all this,&#8221; Avery said, trying to force a bit of brightness into her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There we go.  Yeah.  It does.  Can I get you a treat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Treat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything?  Takeout you like?  Dessert?  Anything special?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shook her head.  &#8220;I guess&#8230; it&#8217;s been a while since I had a sandwich from Heroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do a lot better than a crappy sub sandwich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I- I-&#8221; Avery&#8217;s voice was a bit rough in her throat from fatigue.  &#8220;I got more stuff to grab and do.  It hasn&#8217;t calmed down yet.  Food to go would be good.  Food that&#8217;s&#8230; familiar.  Comforting.  I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her sentences were breaking down into these really small fragments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.  Absolutely.  Heroes it is.  The usual?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded.  She didn&#8217;t really trust herself to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I leave Grumble to you?  You gotta make sure he goes to the bathroom when he gets up.  Help him over?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery nodded again.  She kind of wished her dad would go already.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wipe his bum if he poops?  Make sure he doesn&#8217;t fall off the toilet when he leans over?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded again, a tight little motion.</p>
<p>He rinsed his hands, took her unused drying cloth to dry them, and then ran a hand over her hair as he hurried on to his errand.</p>
<p>Leaving the house essentially empty.</p>
<p>The knot in her throat pulled her chin toward her collarbone and made her feel like she was paralyzed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; she replied, whisper quiet.</p>
<p>Lucy put an arm around Avery&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>Avery waited until she was confident enough to open her eyes without crying or anything, before raising her chin.</p>
<p>Everyone who&#8217;d been able to sleep was gathered for a nightmare meeting.  Rook, the ghouls, and a lot of the goblins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want to talk to Rook?&#8221; Lucy asked.  &#8220;Bring that stuff up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not right now, okay?&#8221; Avery asked.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s figure out where we stand, then,&#8221; Toadswallow said.  &#8220;Starting with a recap for Nibble and Chloe, who couldn&#8217;t attend any of our daytime meetings, and Rook, who is absent on business yet again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can try,&#8221; Lucy said, ending the hug and moving to the front of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,&#8221; Melissa said, nudging Avery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,&#8221; Avery replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You good?  You alright?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nightmares suck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Finally got my ankle fixed up, then fucked everything else up real good.  You?&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shrugged, shaking her head a little.  She pulled out her phone on instinct, checking, then remembered this was a nightmare, and there were no reality to nightmare phone towers.  At least, not any local ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;That bad, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just&#8230; real.  Really gotta get Alpy to go easy on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look really tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  You do realize you&#8217;re asleep, though, right?&#8221; Melissa murmured, keeping her voice quiet so she wouldn&#8217;t interrupt Lucy&#8217;s breakdown of the situation.  &#8220;Sleep equals less tired.  Or it&#8217;s supposed to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not like this.  This is&#8230; not efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery shrugged.</p>
<p>She made herself listen to Lucy&#8217;s explanation, focusing as best as she could, so she didn&#8217;t have to think about broader, bigger issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">🟂</p>
<p>Avery woke up, and listened for activity.</p>
<p>There was nothing.  The house was quiet.</p>
<p>She exhaled slowly, then sat up.</p>
<p>Snowdrop sprung up in front of her.  Avery would have been startled, but the familiar bond didn&#8217;t really allow for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Snow.  What are you up to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a non-answer.  Why&#8217;s the house so quiet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your dad figured it&#8217;d freak you out, so he stowed everyone in the basement.  No more studying for the kids if they&#8217;re pumped with adrenaline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery frowned a little.  &#8220;Took them to the park?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool.  You were spying on &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Your mom isn&#8217;t exactly willing to talk to me, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Avery said.  She closed her eyes for a second.  &#8220;Shit.  Guess it&#8217;s time to go tackle some of this crap, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Snowdrop said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go, kick some ass, tackle the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are.  You&#8217;ve been letting everyone down, crapping out on us, fucking up with your parents.  You gotta get your shit together,&#8221; Snowdrop said, hands on hips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, but if you get out of my way-&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery tried to stand.  Snowdrop pushed her so she flopped back down onto the bed, while Snowdrop stood over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it together!  I&#8217;ll kick your ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a bit goblin influenced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quitting my job as your emotional support opossum and going to be goblin sage today, okay?  So get it together already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow-&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop grabbed a pillow and pressed it into Avery&#8217;s face, then manhandled her leg.  After a bit, she threw the blanket down over Avery&#8217;s legs and then sat on it.  She fished in Avery&#8217;s pocket, which was awkward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ow, ow-&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop became an opossum to use smaller paws to get into the space, back legs pushing into Avery&#8217;s stomach, while Avery tried to manage her, but then didn&#8217;t have the strength.  Avery reached past Snowdrop and got her phone out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking this away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Snowdrop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got crap to do, really important practitioner shit.  You&#8217;ve been fucking up, people have no freaking expectations,&#8221; Snowdrop said.  &#8220;So I&#8217;m taking your phone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snowww-&#8221; Avery groaned.  &#8220;I do not have the energy for you to go full opossum spirit with me right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop handed the phone back to Avery, and Avery saw that Snowdrop had made a call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaa, wait, Snow-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.  Sorry.  Did not intend to make a video call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pocket dial?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go with that,&#8221; Avery said, moving the pillow to put her head down.  &#8220;The best answer I can think of to give is that an obnoxious but well-intentioned opossum dialed your number for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh huh?  Well, I&#8217;m glad, whatever the reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery smiled.  She checked the time.</p>
<p>It felt more like midnight than noon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you might be staying there over Tuesday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be Wednesday too,&#8221; Avery admitted.  &#8220;Wish we could hang out.  How&#8217;s your day going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally done with last week&#8217;s tofurkey leftovers, so I got a normal sandwich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heyy, that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your team invited me to eat with them.  Was nice of them, but then I got called away by the teacher to answer a question, and it was kinda weird to walk over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to hang out with them, you should walk over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for lunch to end, anyway.  How&#8217;s your weekend going?  It sounded like it was going to be pretty intense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  Barely slept last night.  Just finished a nap.  Don&#8217;t know how much longer the house will be quiet.  I guess that&#8217;s the reason for the call,&#8221; Avery said, glancing at Snowdrop.  &#8220;A little dose of normal?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop, sitting on the end of the bed so she could pin the covers down, gave Avery the finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might be one of the worst people to provide normal,&#8221; Nora said.  &#8220;My mom made a gelatin dinner last night.  Gelatin and suspended meat.  That shouldn&#8217;t be a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t.  I bet the opossum would eat it, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdrop gave her the finger again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish you were here,&#8221; Nora said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.  I wish I was there too.  Share my lunch with you.  Go to your place after school, listen to you drumming&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The phone rustled on Nora&#8217;s end.  Then she began tapping.  The angle was bad, but Avery could see the corner of a bit of tupperware, and the little utensils.  Nora did a little drum solo.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta give me something,&#8221; Nora said.  &#8220;Because I think people are looking at me weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super great.  I love it.  You&#8217;re great.  Excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.  Then it&#8217;s worth any weird looks.  I&#8217;m afraid to check.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I was there so I could kiss you,&#8221; Avery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; kiss me the next time you see me,&#8221; Nora said, very quiet, into the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what if I say it again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t complain if you run up the score.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery smiled.  &#8220;I want to watch another movie with you.  Like last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can definitely add that to the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve got a cool thing my friend is making.  I want to show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No hints?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm-nhh,&#8221; Avery grunted her refusal, shaking her head a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Avery&#8217;s eyes closed, and they didn&#8217;t open for another thirty minutes.</p>
<p>She woke to the sound of Kerry screaming downstairs, and the sound of a man- <em>preaching?</em>  She stirred, momentarily confused.</p>
<p>The video call was still running, and the sounds of the kids downstairs mingled with the sound coming over the phone.  Nora was in class, phone in her lap, pointing upward, and the teacher was going over the lesson for the afternoon.  It wasn&#8217;t preaching she&#8217;d heard, but <em>teaching</em>.</p>
<p>Nora was smiling, even though she hadn&#8217;t realized Avery had stirred awake yet.</p>
<p><em>That works for an actual Self recharge</em>, Avery thought.  <em>Thank you, Snowdrop</em>.</p>
